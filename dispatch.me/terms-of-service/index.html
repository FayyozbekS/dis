<p>APPLICATION TERMS OF SERVICE</p>
<p>Last Updated: May 14, 2021</p>
<p>PLEASE READ THESE TERMS OF SERVICE (“TERMS OF SERVICE”) CAREFULLY BEFORE ACCESSING OR USING OR DOWNLOADING ANY DISPATCH APPLICATIONS MADE AVAILABLE EITHER THROUGH A WEB BROWSER OR AS A DOWNLOAD TO YOUR DEVICE (THE “APPLICATIONS” OR “APPS”). BECAUSE THESE TERMS OF SERVICE CONSTITUTE A LEGALLY BINDING CONTRACT BETWEEN YOU AND DISPATCH TECHNOLOGIES, INC. (“DISPATCH,” “WE,” “US,” OR “OUR”) FOR YOUR USE OF THE APPS AND OF DISPATCH SERVICES (DEFINED BELOW).</p>
<p>IF YOU DO NOT ACCEPT OR UNDERSTAND THESE TERMS OF SERVICE, DO NOT ACCESS, USE OR DOWNLOAD ANY APP AND DO NOT CLICK ON ANY “I AGREE” BUTTON PRESENTED TO YOU. BY INDICATING THAT YOU AGREE BELOW, OR BY DOWNLOADING, REGISTERING FOR, ACCESSING OR USING ANY APP, YOU AGREE (1) TO BE BOUND BY THESE TERMS OF SERVICE AND OUR PRIVACY POLICY, AND (2) YOU ARE AT LEAST EIGHTEEN (18) YEARS OLD, AND (3) YOU HAVE READ AND UNDERSTAND THESE TERMS OF SERVICE AND OUR PRIVACY POLICY, AND (4) YOU ACCEPT THESE TERMS OF SERVICE AND OUR PRIVACY POLICY.</p>
<p>Description of Services</p>
<p>The Apps were created by Dispatch to allow you to manage jobs and information through an intuitive web-based API service, available through a web browser or through a mobile device, and to interact with job requestors (together with the Apps, the “Dispatch Services”).</p>
<p>Changes to Terms</p>
<p>We may change, modify, add or remove portions of these Terms of Service (each, an “Update”) at any time and in our sole discretion with or without prior notice to you and such Updates will be effective immediately. If we make Updates to these Terms of Service, we will change the &#8220;Last Updated&#8221; date above and describe the changes in a chart at the bottom of these Terms of Service. Your continued use of an App will confirm your acceptance of the updated Terms of Service. We encourage you to frequently review these Terms of Service to ensure you understand the latest terms and conditions associated with use of the Apps and Dispatch Services. If you do not agree to the updated Terms of Service, you must uninstall and discontinue using the Apps and Dispatch Services.</p>
<p>Privacy Policy</p>
<p>Please refer to our Dispatch Privacy Policy (the “Privacy Policy&#8221;) for information regarding how we collect, use and disclose information about you in connection with your use of the Apps and our provision of Dispatch Services, and regarding how others collect, use and disclose information about you. For example, an App may connect to the GPS of your mobile device so that we can track your location and movement. You consent to our collection, use and disclosure of your Personal Information and User Information (as such terms are defined in our Privacy Policy) in accordance with these Terms of Service and our Privacy Policy.</p>
<p>Dispatch Accounts</p>
<p>To use Dispatch Services, you may be required to create a unique profile called a “Dispatch Account”. Account registration requires you to submit certain personal information to us. You will submit only accurate, up-to-date, complete, and truthful information when creating a Dispatch Account. We have the final discretion in granting accounts, and reserve the right to reject your registration without explanation. You are responsible for all activity that occurs under your Dispatch Account, and you agree to maintain the security and secrecy of authentications, access codes, passwords, and other credentials (as well as any communications transmitting such credentials to you) associated with your Dispatch Account. If you discover or suspect any unauthorized access or other security breaches pertaining to your Dispatch Account or the Dispatch Services in general, please let us know as soon as possible. You may only possess one Dispatch Account at a time.</p>
<p>Once you have created your Dispatch Account, you can securely access the Apps and Dispatch Services. You may deactivate your Dispatch Account at any time, for any reason, through your account settings.</p>
<p>If your right to use Dispatch Services is permitted pursuant to an agreement in place between Dispatch and a business partner of yours, then if Dispatch’s agreement with such business partner terminates, such termination may result in termination of your right to use Dispatch Services.</p>
<p>Terms of Access and Use</p>
<p>· Grant of Rights: Subject to these Terms of Service and your compliance with all applicable laws, Dispatch grants you a personal, non-transferrable, non-exclusive, revocable right to (i) access and use the Dispatch Services, and (ii) access online and/or install the Apps on one or more devices (e.g., an Apple Device (as defined below)) that you own or control for purposes of using the Dispatch Services, and (iii) access and use Dispatch Content and Third Party Content for purposes of using the Dispatch Services.</p>
<p>· Certain Restrictions: The rights granted to you by these Terms of Service are subject to the following restrictions: (a) you shall not license, sell, rent, lease, transfer, assign, distribute, host, or otherwise commercially exploit any Dispatch Services; (b) you shall not modify, translate, adapt, merge, make derivative works of, disassemble, decompile, reverse compile or reverse engineer any part of the Dispatch Services, except to the extent the foregoing restrictions are expressly prohibited by applicable law; (c) you shall not access or use Dispatch Services to build a similar or competitive service or application; (d) no part of Dispatch Services may be copied, reproduced, distributed, republished, downloaded, displayed, posted or transmitted in any form or by any means, and (e) you shall not remove or destroy any copyright notices or other proprietary markings contained on or in any portion of Dispatch Services. Any future release, update, or other addition to the functionality of the Dispatch Services is subject to these Terms of Service, unless otherwise provided in terms associated with such addition.</p>
<p>· Modification of Services: Dispatch may, at any time, modify, suspend, or discontinue the Dispatch Services or any part thereof with or without notice, except we will not discontinue the Purchased Service (defined below) except as provided herein. In the future we may offer additional services, features, functionalities and in-app purchases. Dispatch will not be liable to you or to any third party for any modification, suspension, or discontinuance of the Dispatch Services as permitted herein.</p>
<p>· Ownership: Dispatch and its licensors own all right, title and interest, including all related intellectual property rights, in and to the Dispatch Services. These Terms of Service are not a sale and they do not convey to you any rights of ownership in or related to the Dispatch Services.</p>
<p>Your Content</p>
<p>Certain features of the Dispatch Services may allow you to post, submit, publish, share, store, or manage ideas, opinions, recommendations, data and information, including Information and literary, artistic, musical, or other content, such as photos and videos (both “Content”). By posting or publishing Content, you represent and warrant to us that you have all necessary rights to distribute Content to us, either because you are the author and have the right to distribute the same, or because you have the appropriate distribution rights, licenses, consents, and/or permissions to use, in writing, from the copyright or other owner of the Content. You further represent and warrant that none of the Content you post or publish contains financial, privileged, confidential, personally identifiable or personal information of any kind whatsoever. You hereby grant to Dispatch and our authorized personnel a worldwide, royalty-free, fully-paid, non-exclusive, transferable (in connection with an assignment of the Agreement), sublicensable (as necessary to provide the Dispatch Services) license to copy, publicly perform, publicly display, publish, distribute, create derivative works of, and otherwise exploit information and Content as we in our sole and absolute discretion deem appropriate to perform and to promote (subject to your account settings) the Dispatch Services and in accordance with these Terms of Service. This license ends when you deactivate your Dispatch Account. You acknowledge and agree that we will own all right, title, and interest in and to any materials, content, or other works of authorship created by us or on our behalf and used in connection with the Dispatch Services. We acknowledge and agree that, as between you and Dispatch, you will own all right, title, and interest in and to Content you provide.</p>

Also, you acknowledge that, although some features of the Dispatch Services (including the Apps) may permit integration with third party products, applications and information, your license to use Dispatch Services does not, by itself, convey or imply licensing rights to use any information or products not provided by Dispatch, and separate licensure may be required by third party product providers.</p>
