										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Do you have a customer loyalty process in place? If not, it could be costing you. Research commissioned by American Express says that </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">33% of consumers consider switching brands</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> after just one instance of poor customer service.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To boost customer loyalty, it makes sense to start at the end: Customers often judge your brand by the last interaction they have with you—and since that final interaction is usually with your third-party service providers, these partners can make or break your customer loyalty scores.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you have constant turnover in your service provider network, your customers are the ones who feel the pinch. Miscommunication, missed appointments, service professionals with little knowledge of your brand, and other problems pop up, sinking the </span><a href="https://dispatch.me/solutions/by-need/customer-experience/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">customer experience</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> you spent so long building up.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Because service provider loyalty can have a huge impact on customer loyalty, you want to make working with you as easy for them as possible.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So how do you keep </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">both</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of these groups happy?</span></p>
<h2><strong>How Can I Improve Service Provider and Customer Loyalty?</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Consider your service providers and customers as a two-sided market and your field service management software as the intermediary to build loyalty among both parties.</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Offer multiple ways to connect</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Keep important information—like job status, contact information, and customer photos—flowing between your brand, your customers, and your service providers to keep all parties on the same page.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Make sharing job details easy, fast &amp; clear</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Use an app that shares customer and job details with your service providers—so the customer doesn’t have to explain the issue multiple times, and the service provider has easy access to the information they need to get the job done quickly and efficiently.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Increase service provider loyalty with the right tools</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. A field service management tool that doesn’t integrate with your providers’ in-house software is just another app for them juggle—which can affect your service provider loyalty.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Let customers have their say</b>. Customers want to be heard, so make it easy for them to share their kudos and critiques.</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now let’s get all the details on the table.</span></p>
<h2><strong>Offer Multiple Ways to Connect</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nothing frustrates a customer faster than communication issues with their order. Whether it’s a missed tracking number or a multi-layered phone tree to reach a customer service rep, every stumbling block put in your customer’s way reduces the chance that they’ll buy from you again.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Your service provider network needs easy communication with both you </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">and</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> your end customers to keep appointments on time and customer information up to date.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In both cases, offering multiple channels of communication can help keep information flowing where it needs to go. For example, you might offer a web portal where customers can upload details about their work orders, including photographs. With access to this information, along with a centralized database of customer information, your service providers can do their jobs more efficiently. An app can come into play for service and appointment updates, reducing the number of customer no-shows.</span></p>

<h2><strong>Make Sharing Job Details Easy, Fast &amp; Clear</strong></h2>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Forbes</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> says that </span><a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/shephyken/2019/10/13/customer-loyalty-and-retention-are-in-decline/#33ac06ae4329"><span style="font-weight: 400;">77% of consumers consider convenience a key factor</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in choosing service providers. If your order or service process is confusing or requires customers to jump through too many hoops, they’re going to start looking for a clearer experience elsewhere.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One sticking point for customers is in getting the details of their service order to the provider. If you’re making your customers explain their situation to two or three different people, they’re going to be frustrated before your service partner ever arrives at their home.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You can eliminate that problem, and increase customer loyalty, with a</span> <a href="https://dispatch.me/solutions/service-providers/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">field service management</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> app that allows your providers to easily view the customer’s history and information. They’ll arrive at your customer’s home with the right tools and parts, and your customer won’t have to repeat the whole conversation they just had with your customer care team.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Your field service management software makes the process more convenient for your service partners, too. You can give them access to product information, knowledge bases, and customer data that they need to find answers to any customer questions and get the job done quickly.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">An FSM tool also helps improve service providers’ first-time fix rate (since they’ll have a better understanding of the job before they arrive at the customer’s home), which will further improve customer experience.</span></p>
<h2><strong>Increase Service Provider Loyalty with The Right Tools</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The service management tool you choose needs to enhance your service provider’s workflow. Otherwise, it becomes just one more app taking up space on their phone or tablet—hardly the way to increase service provider loyalty.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The right platform gives you </span><a href="https://dispatch.me/how-are-your-3rd-party-contractors-doing-heres-how-to-find-out/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">visibility into how your service partners are doing</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, while also helping them do their jobs. Give them an easy way to assign and track jobs, see customer notes and photos, and accept payments in the field, and your providers will be much happier to use the tool.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If your platform can integrate with tools your service providers are already using, like QuickBooks, ServiceMax, and Zapier, it’ll improve compliance even further. No one likes having to enter the same information into three different web portals, or having to juggle payment processors.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But if you can bring all of these pieces of their business together into one field service management tool, they’ll be much happier to use it.</span></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="wp-image-14468 aligncenter" src="https://dispatch.me/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/How-to-Ace-Your-Customer-and-Service-Provider-Loyalty2.png" alt="" width="600" height="281" srcset="https://dispatch.me/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/How-to-Ace-Your-Customer-and-Service-Provider-Loyalty2.png 953w, https://dispatch.me/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/How-to-Ace-Your-Customer-and-Service-Provider-Loyalty2-300x140.png 300w, https://dispatch.me/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/How-to-Ace-Your-Customer-and-Service-Provider-Loyalty2-768x359.png 768w, https://dispatch.me/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/How-to-Ace-Your-Customer-and-Service-Provider-Loyalty2-500x234.png 500w, https://dispatch.me/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/How-to-Ace-Your-Customer-and-Service-Provider-Loyalty2-791x370.png 791w, https://dispatch.me/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/How-to-Ace-Your-Customer-and-Service-Provider-Loyalty2-380x178.png 380w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<h2><strong>Let Customers Have Their Say</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Customer feedback is essential to understanding what you’re doing right, and where you need to improve. Tweaking your business operations based on common feedback is a great way to improve your customer retention rates.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But your customers don’t want to have to type in a URL or call a phone number on their invoice. If you make it difficult for your customers to give you feedback, you’ll probably only hear from the really motivated ones (both furious and thrilled). This can give you a skewed sense of how your customers feel about your field service business.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Instead, give your customers a way to leave feedback instantly. Asking them to rate you and/or your service provider immediately after the job’s done means that the job is fresh in the customer’s mind. And with the right customer feedback tool, you and your service providers can spot trends and opportunities for improvement.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Customer loyalty and service provider loyalty are both critical to your brand’s success. By employing tactics and tools to keep both of these groups happy, you can cut down on customer service-related expenses—and keep your business growing.</span></p>
