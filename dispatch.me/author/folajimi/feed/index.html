										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Understanding the performance of your independent service providers, dealers, or franchise locations is one of the most critical and challenging parts of running your service business.</strong> </span>Working with Dispatch gives you access to job and provider data that can help you tailor your network and ultimately improve customer satisfaction through better service experiences delivered by your highest-performing pros.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We are very excited to show off new functionality in our Manage enterprise platform &#8211; Service Provider Profiles &#8211; that will show you detailed performance metrics and trends for your pros, and enable you to make informed decisions about your service operations.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">All of this data is available to both you and your pros, so you can reference Dispatch data when discussing performance with your pros in real time.</span></p>
<h3><b>Schedule View</b></h3>

<p>The new Schedule View allows you to see the schedule for your participating pros, enabling you to better identify pros that have availability that align with your customer’s job timing needs. You’ll be able to see their working hours, their booked hours, and their availability via white space on the calendar view.</p>

<h3><b>Jobs by SLA Performance Report</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This exportable report helps you understand how your pros are performing against your SLAs at a job-level. For each job, see if SLAs were adhered to, and quickly identify pros who are better or worse at hitting your SLAs.</span></p>
<h3><b>Customer Ratings and Reviews</b></h3>

<h3><b>Team Member Performance Report</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Within your service provider partners, we can help you understand the performance of each individual technician or team member. <strong><span style="color: #000000;">This data can be invaluable in your performance conversations with your pros, identifying high-performing team members to emulate, and lower-performing ones that might need some extra attention.</span></strong></span></p>
<h3><b>A new level of performance reporting</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong><span style="color: #000000;">Enjoy unparalleled insight into the performance of your service network</span> </strong>with Dispatch Manage and Service Provider Profiles. </span></p>

]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h4><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Winning lifetime customers</strong> starts and ends with your dealer network</span></h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The HVAC industry is growing quickly, with HVAC projected to register <a href="https://www.grandviewresearch.com/industry-analysis/hvac-equipment-industry#:~:text=The%20global%20HVAC%20systems%20market,factors%20driving%20the%20market%20growth.">a compound annual growth rate of 6.1%</a>  </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">from 2020 to 2027</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The ability to not only grow your base but to also maintain the loyalty of your customers and dealers is now more important than ever.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Due to the many moving pieces included within the HVAC service and installation process, it can be difficult to keep track of everything involved. Dealers may decide to recommend other HVAC brands and customers may decide to purchase a different HVAC brand when their current system fails. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Incentivizing customers and dealers to use your products creates loyalty within these parties and helps guarantee that your products will be used. According to </span><a href="https://nucomfortsupplyinc.com/5-steps-to-an-hvac-customer-retention-strategy-that-works/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Nu Comfort</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> “simply increasing your customer retention rates by 5% can raise your profits by anywhere from 25% to 95%.” While customer retention rates are important, <strong>retaining customers starts with retaining the best dealers to service and sell to them.</strong></span></p>
<h4><b>What is happening to your leads?</b></h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Imagine a scenario where a customer calls in for repair on their Air Conditioning system and has a negative experience with your dealer. Not only does that reflect poorly on the customer but also on your brand. Good customer service is vital to maintaining the loyalty of your customers; although due to the lack of visibility into what happens after you send your leads, <strong>It can be difficult to know what is happening</strong>.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.hvacinformed.com/insights/hvac-businesses-struggling-jolt-covid-19-co-1571129776-ga.1585232684.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">HVAC Informed</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> talks about how associations within the HVAC industry are concerned with local governments potentially limiting or stopping HVAC inspections which could open the way for unqualified and unlicensed installers to take advantage of consumers during the crisis. With many areas in America limiting HVAC inspections some of these concerns have come to light. It only takes one bad visit to lose a customer.</span></p>
<p>Finally, if your dealer isn&#8217;t recommending your brand as a replacement, your losing out on the most important aspect to building loyalty. A lack of visibility can harm your brand reputation and also have a direct impact on your bottom line.</p>
<h4><b>Dealer Loyalty is Customer Loyalty</b></h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Understanding how important service is to driving customer loyalty &#8211; and seeing all the different ways your limited touchpoints with your customers can go wrong &#8211; means it’s more critical than ever to understand what’s happening to your leads.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">HVAC manufacturers need to take advantage of the tools at their disposal. Having something that can give you more insight and visibility into your process is imperative, but it needs to work for your dealers if you want it to work for you.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dispatch provides the connection between you, your dealers, and your customers by giving you more visibility and enabling better customer experiences by<strong> incentivizing your dealers to provide better service and recommend your brand every time</strong>. Dispatch connects every party of the service experience to give companies the tools and information needed to keep their customers happy.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h1 style="text-align: left;"><span style="color: #0fc132;"><b>Vista Equity Partners, Dispatch Investor</b></span></h1>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/Vista_Equity">Vista Equity Partners</a> (Vista) became an investor in Dispatch in September 2018 after being introduced to the company by another Dispatch investor, GrandBanks Capital. <a href="https://www.facebook.com/VistaEquityPartners/">Vista is a leading global investment firm</a> that is exclusively focused on enterprise software, data and technology-enabled businesses. This investment was made out of Vista’s Endeavor Fund, which works with emerging enterprise software companies that are poised for high-growth and offer mission-critical data and software solutions. The Vista Endeavor Fund helps emerging companies expand their product development and make a larger impact in the market they serve by allowing for sustainable growth.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/profile/company/389272Z:US">Vista’s investment</a> in Dispatch has helped enable the firm to further the reach of their existing home services and logistics services technologies. In 2019, Dispatch was ranked on the Inc. 5000 list in the <a href="https://dispatch.me/dispatch-ranked-in-top-10-of-fastest-growing-companies-in-america/">top 10% of the fastest-growing companies</a> in America. René Yang Stewart, Senior Managing Director and Co-Head of the Vista Endeavor Fund said of the investment, “We are thrilled to partner with the Dispatch team to help accelerate growth and continue to enhance the value they bring to home service providers. Dispatch has established a unique position in their ability to connect homeowners, enterprise brands, and service providers which creates a strong platform that we’re excited to help grow and innovate with the Dispatch team.”</p>
<p>Dispatch Chief Strategy Officer, Avi Goldberg, was enthusiastic about <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/vista-equity-partners">Vista backing</a> the Boston-based technology company. He said, “Home service companies have long struggled to meet customer expectations. Companies like Uber and Amazon have raised the bar even further for how a business should interact with its customers. We started Dispatch to bring the same consumer-first technology to the home service market. We do so by seamlessly connecting brands, service providers, and homeowners together, creating a modern, interactive customer experience. This results in two things: happy homeowners and brands with deep insights into their service delivery networks. We’re excited to continue this mission, and specifically chose to partner with Vista because of their strong track record for growing successful SaaS companies around the world.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Delivering excellent service is complex. Customer expectations are higher than ever, and working with independent pros can be challenging. Being able to openly communicate across every party in the service experience can help save operational time and cost, and goes a long way towards giving an excellent service experience for your customers. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Through the Dispatch platform, you can stay in touch with your pros, and they can easily communicate with your customers throughout the job. Take a look at the great messaging features you can get with Dispatch:</span></p>
<h3><b>Enterprise Messaging</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You may already be using our Manage enterprise app and Explore reporting to help manage your pros and understand the quality of the service they are delivering to your customers.

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For each job you’ve assigned to a pro, you can send and receive messages throughout the job lifecycle, giving you the ability to check-in, remediate customer complaints, and just understand the status of your jobs in a more holistic way.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Messaging can be accessed at the job-level. Now, when viewing individual job details, you’ll automatically see the messaging window on the left-hand side of the screen.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When you send messages to your pros, they get in-app and email notifications, and can use their Dispatch Work desktop app to see your messages and respond. All of the messaging around a single job will be included in the job details page throughout the job lifecycle, creating trackable communication between you and your pros.</span></p>
<h3><b>Service Pro Messaging</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the most powerful things about using Dispatch is giving your pros access to world-class field service management tools, helping them deliver excellent experiences for your customers in a transparent and trackable way. Just like our enterprise-facing app, our field service tools enable your pros to communicate effectively with you and your customers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Our Communicate module has always allowed your pros to message with your customers throughout the job lifecycle. Pros can send messages through Dispatch, and customers can reply via email or SMS &#8211; whichever method they prefer. This makes it easy to stay in touch, which can reduce job scheduling and cycle time, and vastly improve the customer experience. Message history is saved at the customer-level, creating a valuable communication log that can further improve your relationship with your customers.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now, we’ve beefed up our Communicate module to include inter-office messaging, streamlining communication between office and field staff so that they can easily communicate with one another within Dispatch. This kind of messaging keeps everyone up-to-date on what’s going on with a job, and encourages the usage of Dispatch for all your pros.</span></p>
<h3><b>Customer Messaging</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Delivering excellent customer experiences is at the core of what Dispatch does, and enabling them to easily communicate with your pros throughout the job is one of the key ways we do that.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As mentioned, it’s easy for your pros to send your customers omni-channel messages during a job, and it’s even easier for them to reply in whatever way is easiest for them.</span></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="wp-image-14723 alignright" src="https://dispatch.me/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/screenshot-3-customer-173x300.png" alt="" width="187" height="325" srcset="https://dispatch.me/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/screenshot-3-customer-173x300.png 173w, https://dispatch.me/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/screenshot-3-customer-213x370.png 213w, https://dispatch.me/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/screenshot-3-customer.png 313w" sizes="(max-width: 187px) 100vw, 187px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As a matter of fact, </span><b>when using our Communicate functionality, we’ve seen star ratings improve by over ¼ star per job</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Being able to ask your pro questions, and answer simple requests ahead of time, makes delivering quick and efficient service easier than ever before.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">All of these messaging features are available through Dispatch, and go a long way to reducing the time it takes to deliver greatly-improved customer service when a job needs to get done.</span></p>
