<p>Choosing the right field service management (FSM) tool is a significant investment in time and resources. Bringing on new solutions is always a challenge as your third- party network has no obligation or incentive to use them, meaning the ROI of your new tool could diminish.</p>
<p>If you’re one of the many home services brands that outsource to a network of third-party service providers, the standard FSM tools won’t be as effective. These solutions are built for dedicated service providers; your third-party network has no obligation or incentive to use them, meaning your investment could be wasted.</p>
<p>Download our white paper at the bottom of this page to learn more about what happens when your service provider network doesn’t adopt your field service management software and how to get them to use it.</p>
<p>For now, enjoy this sample of the white paper.</p>

<h2>What Happens When Your Service Provider Network Doesn’t Adopt Your <strong>Field Service Management Software</strong></h2>
<div class="page" title="Page 3">
<div class="section">
<div class="layoutArea">
<div class="column">
<p>Let’s dive into why it’s key to find software that’s purpose-built for a third-party service provider network. Later, we’ll talk about how to get your service provider to use it happily.</p>
<div class="page" title="Page 3">
<div class="section">
<div class="layoutArea">
<div class="column">
<h3>1. Customer Experience is Inconsistent</h3>
<p>Your third-party service providers are representatives of your home services brand. As Field Service News put it:</p>
<blockquote><p>We are no longer just outsourcing repair and maintenance work, we are now outsourcing a critical customer engagement opportunity as well. In this era of digitally empowered consumers, ready to tweet, post or blog every time they have an ax to grind, you want to make pretty darn sure your third-party partners are not letting you down in the [customer satisfaction] stakes.</p></blockquote>
<div class="page" title="Page 3">
<div class="section">
<div class="layoutArea">
<div class="column">
<p>Many field service management solutions include tools that improve the customer experience, such as customer portals, Uber-style service provider tracking, fast on-site payment capabilities, and an instant feedback feature. When your centralized service staff uses these tools, they create a consistent experience for your customers.</p>
<p>When you rely on third-party service providers who each use their own set of tools, however, your CX becomes unpredictable. Some of your customers will be treated to a streamlined, professional experience, while others deal with late providers and scribbled paper invoices.</p>
<div class="page" title="Page 4">
<div class="layoutArea">
<div class="column">
<blockquote><p>Americans continue to reward companies that get service right. US consumers say they’re willing to spend 17 percent more to do business with companies that deliver excellent service, up from 14 percent in 2014. As a group, Millennials are willing to spend the most for great care (21% additional), followed by men (19%).</p></blockquote>
<div class="page" title="Page 4">
<div class="layoutArea">
<div class="column">
<h3>2. A Decentralized Workforce = <strong>Decentralized Service Data</strong></h3>
<p>Without an FSM tool that your service providers will easily use, you have no visibility into the service providers that are representing your brand and you are losing access to data that could increase service revenue. Are they arriving on time? Are they fixing the problem the first time? Are they invoicing efficiently?</p>
<div class="page" title="Page 4">
<div class="layoutArea">
<div class="column">
<h3>3. You lose time <strong>and money</strong></h3>
<p>You invested in Field Service Management software to become more efficient, scale your business, and grow your revenue. Without buy-in from your third-party service providers, you lose time that could be saved with real-time status updates, mobile capture, and invoicing. As we all know, time is money.</p>
<p>Download the white paper to learn more about how you can attract new talent while building independent service provider loyalty.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>If there is one thing that Amazon.com is about, it’s its obsessive attention to customer experience. Investors should be investing in a company that is obsessing over customer experience. In the long-term, there is never any misalignment between customer interest and shareholder interest.</h2>
<p>Jeff Bezos, CEO Amazon. July 13, 1999</p>
<p>Today’s consumer has access to more information and tools than ever before. With a single Google search, consumers can find the best price for a given product in a matter of seconds.</p>
<p>The only sustainable, long-term differentiator for companies is the end-to-end customer experience customers receive when interacting with a brand. Brands which differentiate by delivering superlative customer experiences will cash in on greater customer wallet share and lifetime value, ultimately netting greater profits and investor returns.</p>
<p>This is because a happy customer <a href="https://www.customerservicemanager.com/how-to-conduct-business-to-business-customer-satisfaction-surveys/">contributes 2.6 times as much revenue</a> as a somewhat satisfied customer and 14 times as much revenue as a somewhat dissatisfied customer. Thus, the need for better customer experience spans many different industries.</p>
<p>The biggest hinderance home service brands face today is delivering a seamless, omnichannel, digital and data-driven experience that connects all parties, including 3rd-party service providers, throughout the customer purchase and home service fulfillment process.</p>
<p>After powering millions of home service jobs in over 30% of the homes in America, here is what we’ve learned for how you can cash in on the home services space.</p>
<h1><strong>Why There is an Opportunity to Cash in on the Home Services Space</strong></h1>
<p>In the early 2000s, home service companies built customer relationships on their own terms. Brands only communicated with customers when they wanted – typically through mailers and calls, or worse, no communication at all, leaving customers in the dark about the status and timing of their home services. Traditional retailers did a fair job executing product sales and deliveries but struggled to execute on expectations set with customers about the home services experience customers would receive.</p>
<p>Over time, due to the rise of the internet, mobile technologies, social media, and lower barriers to entry for new retailers due to the commoditization of hardware/cloud computing, the consumer rose to the forefront, ultimately having an unlimited choice about who, when and where they would purchase. Consumers suddenly had a megaphone to share the negative (and positive) experiences they were receiving from brands, and the ability to quickly and affordably shift their brand loyalty to brands who focused on CX. Industries outside of the field service arena adopted and implemented new technologies to help bridge the gap between the brand and the customer.</p>
<p>This puts pressure on brands to offer the same level of service to their customers in a tech-driven way. When they do, they can expect to see some drastic improvements to their customer SAT, NPS, revenue, and customer lifetime value.</p>
<p>Here are some of the outcomes service brands can expect after implementing customer experience tools.</p>
<h1><strong>Two-Way Communication Tools Improve Brand Perception</strong></h1>
<p>Kudos to you if you’re messaging with your customer about their home services appointment. MAJOR kudos to you if your tool allows for two-way communication with that same customer to create engaging experiences.</p>
<p>Home service companies that enable dynamic communication between them and their customer receive more information up front, which does two things: creates a sense of confidence in the customer’s mind, and allows for seamless fulfillment of the service.</p>
<p><a href="https://dispatch.me">Dispatch</a> allows customers and service providers to directly connect with each other in a bi-directional, modern and meaningful way while empowering the consumer to provide information (notes, photos, updates) to the service provider in advance of service execution. Not only is the customer-empowered, but the service provider is well informed about the service the consumer is expecting to have fulfilled&#8230;.and before appointment execution.</p>
<h1><strong>Automatic Appointment Reminders Improve Customer No-Show Rate</strong></h1>
<p>By keeping consumers informed of the status of their service appointment, including on the day of service, brands can reduce costs associated with customer no shows and reschedule requests. Automatic appointment reminders prevent this from happening.</p>
<h2><a href="https://www.helpscout.com/75-customer-service-facts-quotes-statistics/">54%</a> of millennials prefer to communicate with brands through either mobile or email.</h2>
<p>Not only do consumers prefer to communicate bi-directionally, based on experiences they are having with brands, but consumers expect this level of communication so they are informed and not left in the dark waiting. According to Forrester “The majority (66%) of adults feel that valuing their time is the most important thing a company can do to provide them with good online <a href="https://www.helpscout.com/75-customer-service-facts-quotes-statistics/">customer experience</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://dispatch.me">Dispatch’s</a> omnichannel communication tool delivers email, SMS, push, WhatsApp, or whichever communication method your customers prefer at the right moment.</p>
<h1><strong>Instant Feedback Helps Monitor NPS</strong></h1>
<p>As we evolve in today’s tech-driven world, the importance of immediate data capture becomes vital to reduce customer churn. While every brand will occasionally fail with service delivery, it is essential to be able to immediately act on subpar customer feedback. If your service experience is lacking, then customer switching costs are low and the customer won’t buy more of your product.</p>
<h2>Gauging service experience and remedying poor experiences as they happen has led to a 6% reduction in customer churn (2018 Dispatch customer data study).</h2>
<h1><strong>What is the next step for service companies?</strong></h1>
<p>Brands looking to capitalize on the service space need to realize that it’s all about customer experience. Jeff Bezos had it right in 1999 – amazing service is one of the most important long-term and sustainable differentiators that a brand can build. Done right, positive home services experiences will net greater customer wallet-share, customer lifetime value, and incremental product and services revenue for any brand.</p>

<h2>What you’ll learn in <strong>3-minutes</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We&#8217;re reviewing different protocols that will keep your service providers and customers safe while in the field. </span></p>
<h2>Service Provider <strong>Safety:</strong></h2>
<p><strong>If you can, work remotely</strong><br />
Being isolated away from your team and working out of the comfort of your home is the first step in remaining safe. If you can’t work remotely, make sure to restrict all office visitors with case-by-case emergency situations letting people into the office.</p>
<p><strong>Screen for fever every day</strong><br />
Implement active screening of service providers and office staff for a fever every day with an Infrared Forehead Thermometer.</p>
<p><strong>Keep your distance</strong><br />
Experts suggest maintaining six feet of distance between yourself and other people at all times.</p>
<p><strong>Assess everyone’s health before going out</strong><br />
Before every job, ask your service providers and customers if they’re feeling ill. Reschedule the appointment if the answer is yes.</p>
<p><strong>Adopt contactless communication</strong><br />
With photos, messaging, and digital payments, you can minimize the exposure between service providers and customers. Some companies, like <a href="https://www.bloominblinds.com/">Bloomin&#8217; Blinds</a>, are implementing video consultations in order to adapt their business for this contactless world.</p>
<h2>Customer <strong>Safety:</strong></h2>
<p><b>Wear shoe covers and gloves for every job<br />
</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wear new shoe covers and protective gloves every time you enter the homeowner’s home. This helps ensure cleanliness and puts the homeowner at ease.</span></p>
<p><b>Confirm your customer&#8217;s health<br />
</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Communicate with the customer before the job to gauge their health and their family’s health. If anyone is ill, politely ask to reschedule the appointment.</span></p>
<p><b>Meticulously disinfect tools and trucks<br />
</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Disinfect all vehicles and every piece of equipment after each use. This prevents the virus from spreading surface to surface.</span></p>
<p><b>Implement contactless payments<br />
</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Implement paperless billing, credit card payments, receipts/invoices, etc., so that you and the homeowner don’t need to touch anything.</span></p>
<p><b>Always social distance<br />
</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Stay a minimum of 6 feet away from customers and other service providers at all times and if you’re feeling a little under the weather, please stay home. </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As of March 30,</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">there have been more than 140,000 <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/cases-updates/cases-in-us.html">confirmed</a> cases of COVID-19</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in the U.S. Schools and businesses have closed, travel plans are on hold, and many of us have been ordered to shelter in place.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But field service providers still have to do their jobs. So the question is, how do you keep them safe in and around customers’ homes?</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">How to Keep Your Service Providers—and Customers—<strong>Safe from Coronavirus</strong></span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While there’s no zero-risk way to perform essential work inside customers’ homes, you can take these steps to reduce the chance of spreading COVID-19:</span></p>
<ol>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Update your on-site safety guidelines.</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Base your new rules on CDC guidelines for reducing the risk of spreading the virus.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Keep your distance.</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Experts suggest maintaining six feet of distance between yourself and other people.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Assess everyone’s health before going out.</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Ask your service providers and customers if they’re feeling ill—and reschedule appointments if the answer is yes.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Adopt contactless communication.</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> With photos, messaging, and digital payments, you can minimize exposure between service providers and customers.</span></li>
</ol>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Read on for more details on each step.</span></p>

<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Update Your <strong>On-Site Safety Guidelines</strong></span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Your service providers may be understandably nervous about coming into contact with customers and the equipment in their homes. Giving them guidelines for reducing their risk of contracting or spreading the coronavirus will make them and your customers feel more at ease.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here are a few essential practices for service providers,</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">based on CDC <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/prevention.html?CDC_AA_refVal=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cdc.gov%2Fcoronavirus%2F2019-ncov%2Fprepare%2Fprevention.html">guidelines</a></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Wash your hands</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> before, during, and after each work order. This <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nEzJ_QKjT14">video</a> demonstrates, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">how to ensure you’re scrubbing every part of your hands</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Use hand sanitizer</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> with at least 60% alcohol content if you don’t have access to soap and water.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Don’t touch your face</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (especially your eyes, nose, and mouth). Studies have found that we</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://www.healthline.com/health-news/how-to-not-touch-your-face#Its-a-habit-you-can-break">touch</a> our faces between 16 and 23 times per hour</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">—a habit that can be seriously hard to break. Adding a new ring or a rubber band around your wrist can help make you conscious of your hand, and remind you not to touch your face with it.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Disinfect tools and surfaces</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of any appliance or equipment you’re working with on the job and between work orders. As much as possible, avoid touching any other surfaces in the home; </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">the coronavirus can live on some surfaces for <a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/10.1056/NEJMc2004973">several hours</a></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Add this COVID-19 safety <a href="https://dispatch.me/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Service-Provider-Safety-Checklist-for-COVID-19-1-1.pdf">checklist</a> to every work order</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, so your service professionals don’t have to try to remember the new procedures during busy workdays.</span></li>
</ul>

<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Keep Your <strong>Distance </strong></span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Because COVID-19 spreads through person-to-person contact,</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">maintaining a distance of <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/how-covid-spreads.html?CDC_AA_refVal=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cdc.gov%2Fcoronavirus%2F2019-ncov%2Fprepare%2Ftransmission.html">six feet</a> from other people</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> can reduce the chance of transmission. This might present a challenge in some homes, so prepare your service providers and customers ahead of the visit.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Have an email newsletter, customer text app, or blog? Use whatever </span><a href="https://dispatch.me/solutions/by-product/communicate/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">communications tools</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> you have to let customers know your service professional won’t be shaking hands and that they’ll ask the customer to stay six feet away at all times. Reassure customers that your service professional is disinfecting tools and equipment between visits, and ask that they provide access to a sink and soap.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Finally, take care of as much of the transaction as possible outside the customer’s home. That includes the initial conversations about the work and any paperwork required (more on that shortly).</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Assess everyone&#8217;s health before <strong>rolling trucks</strong></span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While COVID-19 can be asymptomatic, there are some signs you can look for to reduce the chance of spreading it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ask your service providers to notify you if they have any cold or flu symptoms, especially a cough, fatigue, or fever. Any service provider showing these symptoms should stay home, along with any service provider who’s been in contact with a person who tests positive.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Before sending a service professional to your customer’s home, ask if anyone in the house is sick. And make it clear to your service team that they can and should ask the same question once they arrive. If anyone in the home is sick, service providers should check with supervisors to assess whether the work can be rescheduled.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Innovate with <strong>Contactless Communication</strong></span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Your goal should be to limit coronavirus exposure between your field service providers and customers. Leveraging tools with robust messaging capabilities can help you accomplish that task.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A platform that allows text messaging (or even better, video), can help you diagnose the problem before rolling a truck. Connecting virtually before the job ensures technicians arrive with all required parts and tools, meaning fewer exposures between the shop and the customer’s home and less time disinfecting tools</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You can also reduce the chances of infection by improving the way your customer signs off on the job once it’s complete. Instead of a signature on paper, send a confirmation email or ask them to confirm via your app or website. Offer digital payment methods so paper checks don’t have to change hands.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We hope these minor adjustments help your process and workflow as we all continue navigating work-related changes because of COVID-19. Additionally. your work is ensuring homes are safe and comfortable and that is something that homeowners will forever be thankful for. </span></p>

Schedule a demo to see how</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">the <a href="https://dispatch.me/request-a-demo/">right platform</a> can reduce physical contact and keep everyone safer</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For this webinar in 3, we’re discussing if it makes more sense to build enterprise software or to buy enterprise software from a third-party vendor. As a refresher:</span></p>
<p><b>To build </b>means to create the software from scratch. Doing this requires a team of software engineers, a product person, testers, a budget considering total cost of ownership, diligent roadmap planning, and a whole lot of time set aside to maintain the software post-deployment.</p>
<p><b>To Buy</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> means you will work with a vendor that has already built the software you need. They thought of all the nuances, squashed the bugs, are constantly looking for ways to improve their product and have dedicated support to make the client happy. </span></p>
<p>While both these options are good, deciding to buy vs. build comes with its own set of pros and cons. Tune into the 3-minute webinar (yes, just 3-minutes) to learn how you should approach this dilemma and what looming questions you can ask yourself in order to make an educated decision.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thinking about building your own enterprise-level field service management software? It might be tempting—you can customize it to your unique needs, and you may make it with a smaller price tag as well.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But there are a lot of hidden costs waiting to derail your best-laid plans. If you want to keep from being blindsided, check out our list of hidden costs to building (instead of buying) your enterprise software.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">7 Hidden Costs of Building <strong>Your Own Enterprise-Level Software</strong></span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here are the costs you’ll incur when building an enterprise field service management solution. Many of these are time-related costs, but you know the old saying: time is money.</span></p>
<ol>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Before-You-Begin Costs</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> like the time you sink into creating a budget.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Planning Costs</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of building out sprints.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Project Management Costs</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to make sure everything stays on track.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Project Development Costs</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of the QA process and bug fixes.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Training Costs</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for everyone from your tech team to your end-users.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Troubleshooting and Support Costs</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to deal with new bugs and user error.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Maintenance Costs</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of creating patches and new versions of the software.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>BONUS: Opportunity Cost</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">—the time you spend on all this instead of your core business goals.</span></li>
</ol>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now let’s get into the nitty-gritty on the time-and-money outlay that comes with creating your own field service software.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">1. Before-You-Begin <strong>Costs</strong></span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Before you even start the actual software development, you will have time costs associated with your project. One of the first (and, arguably, the most important) is nailing down a general budget.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This also tends to be one of the more difficult costs to determine, according to consulting firm McKinsey. Their research found that</span> <a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/business-functions/mckinsey-digital/our-insights/delivering-large-scale-it-projects-on-time-on-budget-and-on-value"><span style="font-weight: 400;">the average large-scale IT project runs a whopping 45%</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> over budget—and 7% over time. Some of the reasons they cited for these overruns were unclear objectives, an unprepared team, and unrealistic schedules.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You can mitigate some of these issues by hiring a business analyst or product manager, which is the second hidden cost of your software development journey. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you don’t already have this person on your team, it’ll take time to hire someone competent to fill this role. The phrase “time is money” became a cliché for a reason—all of the time you invest in hiring a project manager is time taken away from your other business projects and goals. On top of that is the time for the onboarding and training your new hire will need.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While you’re thinking about hiring, you’ll also have to add developers to your team. This can be a pricey proposition, especially if you need multiple new employees to build your enterprise software &#8211; not to mention the salaries associated with each hire.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">2. Planning <strong>Costs</strong></span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Your next big chunk of costs involves all of your planning activities before the actual development begins. You’ll need time to decide on the most important business objectives (what you want your new software to actually do), the technical requirements to get there, and a blueprint for what that solution will look like.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once you’ve got your goals and a blueprint, your developers need to</span><a href="https://searchsoftwarequality.techtarget.com/definition/Scrum-sprint"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">build out sprints for the project</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Each sprint requires a planning meeting between you and your developers to decide what work will be done in the time period defined by the sprint. The number of sprints and the length of each depends on what you need your software to do for you, but even for small projects the time needed to plan them adds up.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">3. Project Management <strong>Costs</strong></span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now that you’ve got the project and sprints defined, a product manager on board, and developers to actually build your enterprise software, you can just let them get to work, right?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Not exactly. Project management can be a time-consuming process on its own. You’ll have to manage your developers to ensure they get work done on schedule, make sure all development teams are communicating and collaborating effectively, analyze past sprints and plan new ones, and put project monitoring processes in place.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">4. Project Development <strong>Costs</strong></span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once your software is nearing its finished stage, a new set of time-intensive costs pop up. First, you’ll have to put your software through a quality assurance process. Your team should be doing regular QA tests throughout the development process to avoid last-minute disasters, but you’ll still have to sink some time into testing the final (or near-final) version before releasing it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If your QA testing reveals bugs, you’ll have added time costs for fixing them. Finally, before actually handing your software over to end-users, you’ll have to perform an audit to make sure it meets security and compliance requirements.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">5. Training <strong>Costs</strong></span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You can’t just hand your software to your users and let them figure it out on their own. Everyone will need training, from your end-users to your tech support team. That means developing training materials (either written documentation or e-learning courses).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When your materials are finished, you’ll have to provide time for your users to learn the new system—which means staff costs that aren’t going to the regular operation of your business. Depending on the complexity of your new software (and how many hours your employees need to learn it), those costs can be steep. Not quite parallel to this situation but still enlightening, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Training Magazine</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">’s 2017 Training Industry Report found that small businesses</span> <a href="https://trainingmag.com/trgmag-article/2017-training-industry-report/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">spend between $1,100 and $1,886</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to train new employees for 36 to 43 hours. That translates to $30 to $43 per hour.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">6. Troubleshooting and Support <strong>Costs</strong></span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When you build your own software, you’re also on the hook for any ongoing tech support required to deal with new bugs and troubleshooting. Just about any software solution has its own unique set of bugs (and, yes, user errors) that appear regularly.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Beyond the regular troubleshooting time, your IT team will also have to collaborate with your developers to fix these recurring issues in the next iteration of the software (which starts the sprint process all over). They also will have to consider operational costs &#8211; monitoring, care and feeding of databases and storage systems, etc.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">7. Maintenance <strong>Costs</strong></span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So, you’ve got your shiny new enterprise software built, your end-users and support staff have been trained, and your teams are collaborating to keep up with bugs. All done, right?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">No again. Maintenance tasks—like patches and upgrades—can add up, too. Your developer team will have to spend time creating these patches and new versions of the software, while your IT staff spends time implementing and troubleshooting them. Additionally, new security vulnerabilities will need to be mitigated as it pertains to both patches but also the software packages used. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">8. Bonus: Opportunity <strong>Cost</strong></span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">All of the costs related to building your own enterprise software can add up fast, especially if your solution needs to be complex and integrate with a lot of existing systems.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But one cost a lot of businesses may not think about is the hit to the core business. While you’re involved with planning and setting up this new software—which can take months—you’re not as focused on your overall business goals and opportunities.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you’ve got a great business analyst and project manager, the cost here may be minimal. But if you’re really involved with the software production and launch, you may miss other potential areas of growth, which can set your business back.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Case for Buying Instead of <strong>Building Enterprise Software</strong></span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The cost of a purchased software solution may look enormous at first. But when you think about all of the staff time and management/IT costs that go into building your own software, a purchased solution looks a lot more attractive.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With purchased enterprise software, you don’t have the headaches involved with meeting development deadlines, creating your own training materials, or monitoring software health and creating patches and updates. With those issues in mind, a purchased software solution becomes more budget-friendly.</span></p>
