Later, we\u2019ll talk about how to get your service provider to use it happily.<\/p>\n<div class=\"page\" title=\"Page 3\">\n<div class=\"section\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<h3>1. Customer Experience is Inconsistent<\/h3>\n<p>Your third-party service providers are representatives of your home services brand. As Field Service News put it:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>We are no longer just outsourcing repair and maintenance work, we are now outsourcing a critical customer engagement opportunity as well. In this era of digitally empowered consumers, ready to tweet, post or blog every time they have an ax to grind, you want to make pretty darn sure your third-party partners are not letting you down in the [customer satisfaction] stakes.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<div class=\"page\" title=\"Page 3\">\n<div class=\"section\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p>Many field service management solutions include tools that improve the customer experience, such as customer portals, Uber-style service provider tracking, fast on-site payment capabilities, and an instant feedback feature. When your centralized service staff uses these tools, they create a consistent experience for your customers.<\/p>\n<p>When you rely on third-party service providers who each use their own set of tools, however, your CX becomes unpredictable. Some of your customers will be treated to a streamlined, professional experience, while others deal with late providers and scribbled paper invoices.<\/p>\n<div class=\"page\" title=\"Page 4\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<blockquote><p>Americans continue to reward companies that get service right. US consumers say they\u2019re willing to spend 17 percent more to do business with companies that deliver excellent service, up from 14 percent in 2014. As a group, Millennials are willing to spend the most for great care (21% additional), followed by men (19%).<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<div class=\"page\" title=\"Page 4\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<h3>2. A Decentralized Workforce = <strong>Decentralized Service Data<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>Without an FSM tool that your service providers will easily use, you have no visibility into the service providers that are representing your brand and you are losing access to data that could increase service revenue. Are they arriving on time? Are they fixing the problem the first time? Are they invoicing efficiently?<\/p>\n<div class=\"page\" title=\"Page 4\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<h3>3. You lose time <strong>and money<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>You invested in Field Service Management software to become more efficient, scale your business, and grow your revenue. Without buy-in from your third-party service providers, you lose time that could be saved with real-time status updates, mobile capture, and invoicing. As we all know, time is money.<\/p>\n<p>Download the white paper to learn more about how you can attract new talent while building independent service provider loyalty.<\/p>\n<p><strong><br \/>\n<\/strong><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-14548 \" src=\"https:\/\/dispatch.me\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/03\/Loyalty-White-Paper-2-1024x538.jpg\" alt=\"Building Service Provider Loyalty White Paper\" width=\"845\" height=\"444\" srcset=\"https:\/\/dispatch.me\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/03\/Loyalty-White-Paper-2-1024x538.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/dispatch.me\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/03\/Loyalty-White-Paper-2-300x158.jpg 300w, https:\/\/dispatch.me\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/03\/Loyalty-White-Paper-2-768x403.jpg 768w, https:\/\/dispatch.me\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/03\/Loyalty-White-Paper-2-500x263.jpg 500w, https:\/\/dispatch.me\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/03\/Loyalty-White-Paper-2-705x370.jpg 705w, https:\/\/dispatch.me\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/03\/Loyalty-White-Paper-2-380x200.jpg 380w, https:\/\/dispatch.me\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/03\/Loyalty-White-Paper-2.jpg 1200w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 845px) 100vw, 845px\" \/><br \/>\n<!-- [if lte IE 8]>\n<script charset=\"utf-8\" type=\"text\/javascript\" src=\"\/\/js.hsforms.net\/forms\/v2-legacy.js\"><\/script>\n<![endif]--><script charset=\"utf-8\" type=\"text\/javascript\" src=\"\/\/js.hsforms.net\/forms\/v2.js\"><\/script><br \/>\n<script>\n  hbspt.forms.create({\n\tportalId: \"5266136\",\n\tformId: \"46770054-daa1-40be-9a57-6f5b9d18d788\"\n});\n<\/script><\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Choosing the right field service management (FSM) tool is a significant investment in time and resources.
