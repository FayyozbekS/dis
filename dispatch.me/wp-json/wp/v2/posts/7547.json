This willingness to switch brands means that competition for acquiring and satisfying a consumer has drastically increased. In the 50s, an enterprise mostly needed a good product, in the 80s, they needed a good product backed by a strong brand.

Of course, this has a huge benefit for the business, eliminating a large percentage of expensive calls to your call centers.

It also means extending the old first-name-basis customer care to an <a href=\"https:\/\/www.csgi.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/041_Delivering_A_Differentiated_Customer_Experience_In_The_Home.pdf\">uber-like experience<\/a>, where you can see who is coming to your house, eliminating any \u2018stranger-anxiety\u2019.  This has business benefit too \u2013 because the customer knows exactly when their provider will be arriving, more of your appointments will happen, <a href=\"https:\/\/dipatchmestage.wpengine.com\/well-managing-3rd-party-contractors\/\">reducing no-shows by up to 86%<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/dispatch.me\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/08\/Artboard-3-2-1.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"630\" height=\"268\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-14211\" srcset=\"https:\/\/dispatch.me\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/08\/Artboard-3-2-1.png 630w, https:\/\/dispatch.me\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/08\/Artboard-3-2-1-300x128.png 300w, https:\/\/dispatch.me\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/08\/Artboard-3-2-1-500x213.png 500w, https:\/\/dispatch.me\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/08\/Artboard-3-2-1-380x162.png 380w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 630px) 100vw, 630px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Be Heard is the flip side of Informed and Involved. It now only takes a few clicks and a minute for a customer to leave a permanent, public account of their experience with you. While that can be nerve racking, consumers expect to be able to use this voice.
