Here\u2019s why.<\/p>\n<p>For a long time, homeowners have dealt with brands that offer a less-than-ideal experience, filled with long service windows, no visibility into where the technician is, few communication channels, and no opportunity for immediate customer feedback. The lack of these experiences are what drive negative customer experiences and when companies don\u2019t have the right technology, it\u2019s hard to satisfy the customer.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/dispatch.me\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/11\/The-New-Best-Practices-for-Warranty-Companies-blog-image-4-1.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"715\" height=\"500\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-14194\" srcset=\"https:\/\/dispatch.me\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/11\/The-New-Best-Practices-for-Warranty-Companies-blog-image-4-1.png 715w, https:\/\/dispatch.me\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/11\/The-New-Best-Practices-for-Warranty-Companies-blog-image-4-1-300x210.png 300w, https:\/\/dispatch.me\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/11\/The-New-Best-Practices-for-Warranty-Companies-blog-image-4-1-500x350.png 500w, https:\/\/dispatch.me\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/11\/The-New-Best-Practices-for-Warranty-Companies-blog-image-4-1-529x370.png 529w, https:\/\/dispatch.me\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/11\/The-New-Best-Practices-for-Warranty-Companies-blog-image-4-1-380x266.png 380w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 715px) 100vw, 715px\" \/><\/p>\n<h1><strong>The new homeowner expectations<\/strong><\/h1>\n<p>Homeowner expectations have changed. They expect to be at the center of every experience with full transparency into what is going on. When looking back at history, we can thank one person for this shift in expectations, Steve Jobs. When Jobs introduced the iPhone to consumers the speed in which information passed from hand to hand dramatically increased. This created a new expectation from customers as these devices became the main connection point between them and brands. It was one of the largest power shifts in the business-consumer relationship.<\/p>\n<p>But this was 11 years ago. A lot has changed. Businesses like Amazon, Uber, and OpenTable have accelerated this power shift and created experiences that are now expected by consumers.  <\/p>\n<ul style=\"margin:0;padding:0;\">\n<li>Amazon solved logistics by removing the human from the equation.<\/li>\n<li>Uber provided full transparency into when, where, and who will be driving.<\/li>\n<li>OpenTable streamlined the way we book restaurant reservations.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Because of this, businesses realize that in order to compete in today\u2019s market, customer experience needs to be a high priority, and industries are either adopting this mindset or being left behind. Here are a few examples:<\/p>\n<ul style=\"margin:0;padding:0;\">\n<li><strong>Banking experiences are improving<\/strong> \u2013 Capital One Cafes are turning bank visits into banking experiences\u2026 \u201cbanking reimagined.\u201d<\/li>\n<li><strong>Ophthalmology experiences are improving<\/strong> \u2013 Warby Parker made it easy to try on and order a pair of glasses directly from your living room.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Home decor experiences are improving<\/strong> \u2013 Wayfair\u2019s VR app lets customers visualize the layout of their new furniture in their home before they even buy it.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>The next industry ready for a shakeup is warranty services. Here\u2019s why&#8230;<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/dispatch.me\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/11\/The-New-Best-Practices-for-Warranty-Companies-blog-image-3-1.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"715\" height=\"500\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-14196\" srcset=\"https:\/\/dispatch.me\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/11\/The-New-Best-Practices-for-Warranty-Companies-blog-image-3-1.png 715w, https:\/\/dispatch.me\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/11\/The-New-Best-Practices-for-Warranty-Companies-blog-image-3-1-300x210.png 300w, https:\/\/dispatch.me\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/11\/The-New-Best-Practices-for-Warranty-Companies-blog-image-3-1-500x350.png 500w, https:\/\/dispatch.me\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/11\/The-New-Best-Practices-for-Warranty-Companies-blog-image-3-1-529x370.png 529w, https:\/\/dispatch.me\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/11\/The-New-Best-Practices-for-Warranty-Companies-blog-image-3-1-380x266.png 380w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 715px) 100vw, 715px\" \/><\/p>\n<h1><strong>What the New Warranty Experience Should Look Like<\/strong><\/h1>\n<p>Imagine a warranty experience where the homeowner can, in a matter of minutes, schedule a job on their phone without ever having the back-and-forth phone tag with you and the 3rd-party service provider?<\/p>\n<p>Imagine a warranty experience where the homeowner can track every important appointment update, see where the technician is on a live map, and feel informed every step of the way? (reducing those, \u201cWhere\u2019s my tech?\u201d phone calls.)<\/p>\n<p>Imagine a warranty experience where the homeowner can text and call the technician to inform them of any change to their schedule? (reducing costly \u201cno-shows.\u201d)<\/p>\n<p>Imagine a warranty experience where the homeowner can share a picture of what is wrong, aid in capturing the model\/serial number and help the tech fix it right the first time.<\/p>\n<p>Imagine a warranty experience where the homeowner can leave immediate feedback about how well the service provider performed? (giving real-time visibility into customer satisfaction and technician performance.)<\/p>\n<p>Imagine a warranty experience as simple, transparent, and easy as Uber, OpenTable, and Amazon?<\/p>\n<p>Well, you don\u2019t need to imagine anymore.<\/p>\n<p>Dispatch is already used by some of the world\u2019s largest OEM companies. They use us to gain full visibility into their 3rd-party contractor network that otherwise wasn\u2019t measurable. Additionally, customers are now experiencing the same tech-driven experiences that they\u2019ve come to expect from modern brands like Amazon and Ubers.<\/p>\n<p>To learn more about how your warranty service can offer better customer experiences, send us an email (<a href=\"mailto:support@dispatch.me\">support@dispatch.me<\/a>).
