Research commissioned by American Express says that <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">33% of consumers consider switching brands<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> after just one instance of poor customer service.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To boost customer loyalty, it makes sense to start at the end: Customers often judge your brand by the last interaction they have with you\u2014and since that final interaction is usually with your third-party service providers, these partners can make or break your customer loyalty scores.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you have constant turnover in your service provider network, your customers are the ones who feel the pinch.

Keep important information\u2014like job status, contact information, and customer photos\u2014flowing between your brand, your customers, and your service providers to keep all parties on the same page.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>Make sharing job details easy, fast &amp; clear<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. Use an app that shares customer and job details with your service providers\u2014so the customer doesn\u2019t have to explain the issue multiple times, and the service provider has easy access to the information they need to get the job done quickly and efficiently.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>Increase service provider loyalty with the right tools<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. A field service management tool that doesn\u2019t integrate with your providers\u2019 in-house software is just another app for them juggle\u2014which can affect your service provider loyalty.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>Let customers have their say<\/b>. Customers want to be heard, so make it easy for them to share their kudos and critiques.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Now let\u2019s get all the details on the table.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><strong>Offer Multiple Ways to Connect<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nothing frustrates a customer faster than communication issues with their order. Whether it\u2019s a missed tracking number or a multi-layered phone tree to reach a customer service rep, every stumbling block put in your customer\u2019s way reduces the chance that they\u2019ll buy from you again.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Your service provider network needs easy communication with both you <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">and<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> your end customers to keep appointments on time and customer information up to date.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In both cases, offering multiple channels of communication can help keep information flowing where it needs to go. For example, you might offer a web portal where customers can upload details about their work orders, including photographs. With access to this information, along with a centralized database of customer information, your service providers can do their jobs more efficiently. An app can come into play for service and appointment updates, reducing the number of customer no-shows.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-14467 \" src=\"https:\/\/dispatch.me\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/02\/How-to-Ace-Your-Customer-and-Service-Provider-Loyalty1.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"600\" height=\"281\" srcset=\"https:\/\/dispatch.me\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/02\/How-to-Ace-Your-Customer-and-Service-Provider-Loyalty1.png 953w, https:\/\/dispatch.me\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/02\/How-to-Ace-Your-Customer-and-Service-Provider-Loyalty1-300x140.png 300w, https:\/\/dispatch.me\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/02\/How-to-Ace-Your-Customer-and-Service-Provider-Loyalty1-768x359.png 768w, https:\/\/dispatch.me\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/02\/How-to-Ace-Your-Customer-and-Service-Provider-Loyalty1-500x234.png 500w, https:\/\/dispatch.me\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/02\/How-to-Ace-Your-Customer-and-Service-Provider-Loyalty1-791x370.png 791w, https:\/\/dispatch.me\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/02\/How-to-Ace-Your-Customer-and-Service-Provider-Loyalty1-380x178.png 380w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" \/><\/p>\n<h2><strong>Make Sharing Job Details Easy, Fast &amp; Clear<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Forbes<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> says that <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.forbes.com\/sites\/shephyken\/2019\/10\/13\/customer-loyalty-and-retention-are-in-decline\/#33ac06ae4329\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">77% of consumers consider convenience a key factor<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> in choosing service providers. If your order or service process is confusing or requires customers to jump through too many hoops, they\u2019re going to start looking for a clearer experience elsewhere.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One sticking point for customers is in getting the details of their service order to the provider. If you\u2019re making your customers explain their situation to two or three different people, they\u2019re going to be frustrated before your service partner ever arrives at their home.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You can eliminate that problem, and increase customer loyalty, with a<\/span>\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/dispatch.me\/solutions\/service-providers\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">field service management<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> app that allows your providers to easily view the customer\u2019s history and information. They\u2019ll arrive at your customer\u2019s home with the right tools and parts, and your customer won\u2019t have to repeat the whole conversation they just had with your customer care team.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Your field service management software makes the process more convenient for your service partners, too. You can give them access to product information, knowledge bases, and customer data that they need to find answers to any customer questions and get the job done quickly.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">An FSM tool also helps improve service providers\u2019 first-time fix rate (since they\u2019ll have a better understanding of the job before they arrive at the customer\u2019s home), which will further improve customer experience.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><strong>Increase Service Provider Loyalty with The Right Tools<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The service management tool you choose needs to enhance your service provider\u2019s workflow. Otherwise, it becomes just one more app taking up space on their phone or tablet\u2014hardly the way to increase service provider loyalty.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The right platform gives you <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/dispatch.me\/how-are-your-3rd-party-contractors-doing-heres-how-to-find-out\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">visibility into how your service partners are doing<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, while also helping them do their jobs. Give them an easy way to assign and track jobs, see customer notes and photos, and accept payments in the field, and your providers will be much happier to use the tool.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If your platform can integrate with tools your service providers are already using, like QuickBooks, ServiceMax, and Zapier, it\u2019ll improve compliance even further. No one likes having to enter the same information into three different web portals, or having to juggle payment processors.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But if you can bring all of these pieces of their business together into one field service management tool, they\u2019ll be much happier to use it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-14468 aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/dispatch.me\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/02\/How-to-Ace-Your-Customer-and-Service-Provider-Loyalty2.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"600\" height=\"281\" srcset=\"https:\/\/dispatch.me\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/02\/How-to-Ace-Your-Customer-and-Service-Provider-Loyalty2.png 953w, https:\/\/dispatch.me\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/02\/How-to-Ace-Your-Customer-and-Service-Provider-Loyalty2-300x140.png 300w, https:\/\/dispatch.me\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/02\/How-to-Ace-Your-Customer-and-Service-Provider-Loyalty2-768x359.png 768w, https:\/\/dispatch.me\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/02\/How-to-Ace-Your-Customer-and-Service-Provider-Loyalty2-500x234.png 500w, https:\/\/dispatch.me\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/02\/How-to-Ace-Your-Customer-and-Service-Provider-Loyalty2-791x370.png 791w, https:\/\/dispatch.me\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/02\/How-to-Ace-Your-Customer-and-Service-Provider-Loyalty2-380x178.png 380w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" \/><\/p>\n<h2><strong>Let Customers Have Their Say<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Customer feedback is essential to understanding what you\u2019re doing right, and where you need to improve. Tweaking your business operations based on common feedback is a great way to improve your customer retention rates.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But your customers don\u2019t want to have to type in a URL or call a phone number on their invoice. If you make it difficult for your customers to give you feedback, you\u2019ll probably only hear from the really motivated ones (both furious and thrilled). This can give you a skewed sense of how your customers feel about your field service business.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Instead, give your customers a way to leave feedback instantly. Asking them to rate you and\/or your service provider immediately after the job\u2019s done means that the job is fresh in the customer\u2019s mind. And with the right customer feedback tool, you and your service providers can spot trends and opportunities for improvement.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Customer loyalty and service provider loyalty are both critical to your brand\u2019s success. By employing tactics and tools to keep both of these groups happy, you can cut down on customer service-related expenses\u2014and keep your business growing.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>Struggling with ways to help your third-party service providers delight your customers?<\/b><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With robust communication, scheduling, and feedback tools, Dispatch can improve your customer experience from purchase to service delivery. <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/dispatch.me\/request-a-demo\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Schedule a demo<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> to see all it can do for you.<\/span><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Do you have a customer loyalty process in place?
