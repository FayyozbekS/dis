As a matter of fact, the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.google.com\/url?q=https:\/\/nrf.com\/insights\/economy\/state-retail&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1615823376943000&amp;usg=AOvVaw3NTb1XnWRm326nl6Fyt3om\">National Retail Federation<\/a> says brick and mortar retail has been growing at roughly 4% per year since 2010, with eCommerce sales only accounting for 10% of all retail sales across the industry.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">No, brick and mortar retail didn\u2019t die when threatened by the Amazons of the world <span style=\"color: #0fc132;\">&#8211; <\/span><\/span><span style=\"color: #0fc132;\"><b>but it did evolve.<\/b><\/span><\/p>\n<h3><b>Give the people what they need<\/b><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Recognizing this threat, consumer electronics retailer Best Buy reconsidered what would keep people coming through their doors. You can buy a new laptop anywhere, but what happens when that laptop breaks? Best Buy knew that <\/span><span style=\"color: #0fc132;\"><b>excellent service experiences are what built customer loyalty<\/b><\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, and made the savvy move of acquiring Geek Squad in 2002.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The concept was simple &#8211; we know that we are going to lose sales to Amazon. We know people can buy a new laptop anywhere, including from the comfort of their own home. But what happens when that laptop breaks?<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nearly 20 years later, Geek Squad has become synonymous with computer repair.

Completely new revenue; turning a negative into a positive.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><b>Modern customer loyalty<\/b><\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Many stores have caught on to this, including Amazon, and now offer service, maintenance, and installation along with the products they sell. According to American Express, \u2018U.S. consumers are willing to spend 17% more to do business with companies that deliver excellent service, up from 14% in 2014.\u2019 So it stands to reason that <\/span><span style=\"color: #0fc132;\"><b>adding service options to your product sales gives you more opportunity to build loyalty.<\/b><\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The need for service is clear, but how do you deliver it consistently to your customers, and not turn your great opportunity to build loyalty into another lost customer?<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><b>A declaration of independence<\/b><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Today, retailers are turning to independent service providers to provide service to their customers. Whether you\u2019re mounting a TV or installing an HVAC system, having the right service provider on deck to do a job is critical to adding significant service revenue to your bottom line.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the absence of a fully trained and skilled workforce, you can offer your jobs to independent contractors. This is where Dispatch comes in.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Dispatch gives you <\/span><span style=\"color: #0fc132;\"><b>a platform to onboard and manage your service providers<\/b><\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, ensuring you have the coverage you need to earn service revenue and customer loyalty across the country. Of course, you need to make sure your providers are delivering consistently excellent service experiences to your customers if you hope to build loyalty, so a platform that allows you to control the customer experience and understand customer satisfaction is critical.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you are a retailer that is looking for a way to take control of your service offering and ensure you are taking advantage of these critical loyalty-building opportunities, take a look at what Dispatch has to offer:<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<script>\n\t\t\t\t\t\thbspt.enqueueForm({\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tportalId: 5266136,\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tformId: \"f38cfb68-33cc-4901-ac26-955040b8ca12\",\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\ttarget: \"#hbspt-form-1636566639000-4954783565\",\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tshortcode: \"wp\",\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tregion: \"\",\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t});\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/script>\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hbspt-form\" id=\"hbspt-form-1636566639000-4954783565\"><\/div><\/span><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Building Retail Customer Loyalty through Home Service The retail landscape has changed fundamentally over the past 20 years.
