I managed a SaaS application before \u201cSaaS\u201d was a well-known term (we called SaaS \u201cASPs,\u201d which stood for \u201cApplication Service Providers\u201d). I\u2019ve learned the fundamentals of business while working side-by-side with CEOs at internet startups that survived the dot.com bubble. I\u2019ve helped take companies from sub ten million to over one hundred million in revenue. I\u2019ve rebuilt products from scratch and learned how to navigate the tricky waters of enterprise software.<\/p>\n<p>All these experiences led me to the next exciting role in my career &#8211; CEO of Dispatch Technologies.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/dispatch.me\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/03\/DSC04049-1024x761.jpg\" alt=\"Pat Burns &amp; Avi Goldberg\" width=\"740\" height=\"533\" \/><\/p>\n<h2><strong>The Three Key Factors that Convinced Me<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>Like any important life decision, it was not an easy one. I had another choice from an exceptional company that lined up well with my accomplishments and ambitions. However, the more I learned about Dispatch, the more compelling it became. I realized I wanted more than just to be successful &#8212; I wanted to build something meaningful, and fulfilling, and innovative and rewarding. Dispatch provides all that and more. Here\u2019s why:<\/p>\n<h3>The Dispatch Opportunity<\/h3>\n<p>As you\u2019re reading this, service organizations are facing new challenges, change, and disruption at a rapid rate. This is because two key dynamics are at play:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>Customer expectations are higher than ever &#8211; driving the need for better, more differentiated customer experiences.<\/li>\n<li>The home service industry is in the midst of a digital revolution, which most enterprises need help navigating.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>Look around, we live in a world where the bar for excellent service experience is increasing. Dispatch\u2019s innovative technology helps service organizations address these challenges head-on by not only improving operational effectiveness &#8211; like being on time and improving response rate &#8211; but helping generate more revenue and loyal customers through better service interactions and digital automation.<\/p>\n<p>This is why the opportunity for Dispatch is enormous.<\/p>\n<p>You can hear more about it in my fireside chat with Avi Goldberg, founder and CSO.<\/p>\n<div class=\"wistia_responsive_padding\" style=\"padding: 56.25% 0 0 0; position: relative;\">\n<div class=\"wistia_responsive_wrapper\" style=\"height: 100%; left: 0; position: absolute; top: 0; width: 100%;\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wistia_embed\" title=\"Pat Burns &amp; Avi Goldberg discuss the CEO transition Video\" src=\"https:\/\/fast.wistia.net\/embed\/iframe\/u7p5dwk3yz?videoFoam=true\" name=\"wistia_embed\" width=\"100%\" height=\"100%\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n<\/div>\n<p><script src=\"https:\/\/fast.wistia.net\/assets\/external\/E-v1.js\" async><\/script><\/p>\n<h3>Ownership and Growth Environment<\/h3>\n<p>Dispatch is owned by <a href=\"https:\/\/dispatch.me\/vista-equity-partners-dispatch-technologies\/\">Vista Equity Partners<\/a> &#8211; one of the most successful enterprise software investment firms on the planet. Because of my previous experience in a Vista company, I know they are a supportive, collaborative partner who will help grow the business and provide expert strategic guidance. Our ability to succeed and execute on our mission will be greatly impacted by this environment, and I\u2019ve seen what a difference it can make.<\/p>\n<h3>Dispatch\u2019s Motivating Mission<\/h3>\n<p>One of the things I say to my children is, you may not be fortunate enough to do the one thing you love most in the world for a living &#8212; but make sure it\u2019s something you deeply care about. When I realized (at too young an age) that I wasn\u2019t going to play centerfield for the Yankees, I still knew that I wanted to do meaningful work that made a difference in peoples\u2019 lives.<\/p>\n<p>And that\u2019s where the mission of Dispatch comes in. I love the idea of creating solutions that improve efficiency and productivity while also enabling businesses to do more with less.<\/p>\n<p>We enable teams to improve service delivery, increase revenue, strengthen customer loyalty, and create economic development and job growth.<\/p>\n<p>Does it get any better than that?<\/p>\n<p>I especially love the idea of helping service organizations transform themselves and flip the customer experience revolution and digital transformation of business from disruption to opportunity.<\/p>\n<p>Between all of this, I\u2019m fortunate to have an amazing partner to work with, founder and Chief Strategy Officer Avi Goldberg, as well as an incredibly talented and committed team.<\/p>\n<p>I can\u2019t wait to see what the future holds for Dispatch and be a part of making it happen.
