Account User Filters allow you to display or suppress certain data depending on the user.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This flexibility opens up endless possibilities around who can benefit from Manage, even if you don\u2019t want everyone to have complete visibility into all of your data. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This even allows you to enable users outside your organization to see certain things. This is great for distributors, dealers, or service providers who work closely with your organization and could benefit from some of the great reports you have access to.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Account User Filters are available to all Manage users. Work with your Dispatch account manager to enable them today!<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><b>Technician Reporting<\/b><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When you look at your service providers in Manage, you can see valuable data such as SLA compliance and average customer reviews. Our reporting gets even more granular, though, allowing you to see metrics about the people in the field actually doing your jobs. We call this Technician Reporting &#8211; though it isn\u2019t limited to just field service technicians.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-14981\" src=\"https:\/\/dispatch.me\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/06\/Technician-Reporting.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1681\" height=\"458\" srcset=\"https:\/\/dispatch.me\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/06\/Technician-Reporting.png 1681w, https:\/\/dispatch.me\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/06\/Technician-Reporting-300x82.png 300w, https:\/\/dispatch.me\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/06\/Technician-Reporting-1024x279.png 1024w, https:\/\/dispatch.me\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/06\/Technician-Reporting-768x209.png 768w, https:\/\/dispatch.me\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/06\/Technician-Reporting-1536x418.png 1536w, https:\/\/dispatch.me\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/06\/Technician-Reporting-1444x393.png 1444w, https:\/\/dispatch.me\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/06\/Technician-Reporting-500x136.png 500w, https:\/\/dispatch.me\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/06\/Technician-Reporting-840x229.png 840w, https:\/\/dispatch.me\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/06\/Technician-Reporting-380x104.png 380w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1681px) 100vw, 1681px\" \/><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Service providers sometimes have difficulty determining performance at a technician-level.
