After scheduling a job, homeowners are left in the dark, wondering what is happening, if the technician will arrive on time, and who will be showing up. This is an issue\u2026<\/p>\n<p>When customers are informed about what is happening, they\u2019re content, they\u2019re happy, and they have little uncertainty about the job.  Alternatively, when they\u2019re not informed about the job, and don\u2019t know who is coming or when they quickly build anxiety about the service as a whole. They build resentment toward the brand and look for the slightest thing to go wrong in order to validate their anger.  Say the technician happens to be late, they\u2019ll say, \u201csee, I knew this would happen.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>At the end of the day, customers expect more, they demand more, but most of all, they deserve more.<\/p>\n<p>After working with some of the largest home service enterprise brands in the world, we\u2019ve found that in order to improve NPS and customer satisfaction, telco companies should provide these three things:<\/p>\n<ul style=\"margin:0;padding:0;\">\n<li>More communication with the customer after the job is scheduled<\/li>\n<li>Omni-channel communication to match the customer\u2019s  (sms, phone, email, twitter, FB, etc.)<\/li>\n<li>Immediate customer feedback after a job is complete<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>As other in-home service companies innovate and raise the \u201ccustomer experience bar,\u201d it\u2019s time for you to do the same.  So, if you\u2019re saying to yourself, \u201cwe want to improve but don\u2019t know how without overhauling our entire system,\u201d then keep reading&#8230;<\/p>\n<h1><strong>We are the Experts in Last Mile Customer Experience (CX)<\/strong><\/h1>\n<p>Over the years, we\u2019ve discovered a few things. First, every field service company is different and having one blanket system for their needs won\u2019t work. Secondly, all field service companies have unique levers that can vastly improve customer experience \u2014 it\u2019s comes down to collecting the right data in order to discover them.<\/p>\n<p>Our experience has shown that implementing Uber-like customer experiences, and automatic appointment reminders have helped large service companies increase their NPS scores by more than 35% and decreases their inbound call-volume by more than 37%. On a large scale when companies are getting hundreds of thousands of calls a month, lowering these calls and increasing NPS has been game-changing.<\/p>\n<p>The data clearly shows that metrics improve because customers feel empowered. At the end of the day, customers just want to know what is happening with their appointment \u2013 reducing anxiety and uncertainty.<\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s that simple.<\/p>\n<p>Customers don\u2019t expect much, they just expect transparent communication, and when it\u2019s not met, they quickly become detractors from your brand, hurting your online reputation.<\/p>\n<p>Our mission is to help every service company deliver memorable (and most of all, repeatable) customer experiences. Dispatch provides modern day solutions to old world home service problems. If you are interested in learning more, schedule some time with us and let\u2019s see how we can help.
