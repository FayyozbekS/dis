Or, you have to wait for your 3rd-party network to update you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">That&#8217;s why it\u2019s critical to get real-time data on what your service network is up to. Here&#8217;s how to get that visibility, and improve your customer experience, from the instant they call the service provider <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/dipatchmestage.wpengine.com\/how-digitizing-the-last-mile-customer-experience-pays-off-for-your-home-warranty-brand\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">all the way through the last mile<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h1><strong>Give Your Third-Party Service Providers a Tool They&#8217;ll Actually Use<\/strong><\/h1>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A great field service management platform allows your independent service providers to manage jobs easily, while at the same time giving you greater visibility into the process. You can receive status updates on the service provider\u2019s location or ETA to your customer\u2019s location, their arrival time, when work is completed, job cycle time and more.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-13512\" src=\"https:\/\/dispatch.me\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/01\/How-Are-Your-3rd-Party-Contractors-Doing-Here\u2019s-How-to-Find-Out-3.png\" alt=\"How Are Your 3rd-Party Contractors Doing?

Here\u2019s how to incentivize your network to use the tool, so you can gain greater visibility into what they\u2019re doing.<\/span><\/p>\n<h1><strong>Let Them Integrate Their Own Tools<\/strong><\/h1>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If your service provider network isn\u2019t using their own FSM tool, then they\u2019re probably using pen and paper. But, if they are using an existing FSM tool like FieldEdge or Rossware, then you\u2019ll want to give them a tool that integrates into those systems. That\u2019s because you don\u2019t want to interrupt their workflow and way of working already, you just want insight into their day-to-day. That way your independent service provider can work with the system that they already love while enabling status back to you.\u00a0\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h1><strong>Give It to Them Gratis<\/strong><\/h1>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Another way to encourage your network to embrace your field service management software is to offer access to their service providers for free. After all, what incentive do they have to use a tool they have to pay for? Giving it to them on the house will let them use the software with their other customers as well, which will boost buy-in.<\/span><\/p>\n<h1><strong>Look to Your FSM Software Provider For Help<\/strong><\/h1>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Finally, go with a field service management software provider that has a dedicated <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">engagement team, and a methodology to help make sure the tool is used by your network.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Pro tip: Dispatch has a best-in-class engagement team to help any enterprise onboard their independent service provider network in no time.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h1><strong>Get Automated Insights into Your Third-Party Service Network<\/strong><\/h1>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Maybe you get all the visibility you need through non-automated communications with your third-party network and your online portal. But what are you doing with the information you uncover? And, is that information accurate and in real-time?<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You need to be able to easily access the data and compile reports\u2014so you can develop insights into your business and take the right actions to improve customer service.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-13513\" src=\"https:\/\/dispatch.me\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/01\/How-Are-Your-3rd-Party-Contractors-Doing-Here\u2019s-How-to-Find-Out-2.png\" alt=\"How Are Your 3rd-Party Contractors Doing? Here\u2019s How to Find Out \" width=\"600\" height=\"499\" \/><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">An automated platform lets you quickly compile reports on your third-party service network\u2019s compliance, time-to-schedule, real-time appointment status updates, and more. This information gives you a comprehensive view of how your network is performing.<\/span><\/p>\n<h1><strong>Make Homeowners Your Eyes and Ears<\/strong><\/h1>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">No matter how good your service-provider network management tool is, you can&#8217;t see <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/dipatchmestage.wpengine.com\/6-steps-for-creating-the-best-in-home-customer-experience\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">into customers&#8217; homes<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and watch how the visits go down.

It also:<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>\u25cf Gives you a chance to improve your business<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u2014and your service providers&#8217; businesses as well. Knowing how customers feel about the services they received benefits everyone.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>\u25cf Boosts customer loyalty.<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> A <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/hbr.org\/2018\/01\/how-customer-service-can-turn-angry-customers-into-loyal-ones\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">study in <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Harvard Business Review<\/span><\/i><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> showed that customers are willing to pay more for a company&#8217;s products later if the company responds to their feedback.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>\u25cf Saves you money on marketing.<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> There&#8217;s no point in throwing money at marketing if your services need improvement, <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/clutch.co\/agencies\/branding\/resources\/why-listening-customer-feedback-matters\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">according to an article by the business directory Clutch<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. Collecting and analyzing the customer feedback sent through your FSM app helps ensure that your brand and its service providers are in alignment with the image you want to project.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Field service management tools are key in getting visibility into your independent service providers\u2014but feedback from actual humans will fill in the gaps and give you a clear view of how your service network is performing.<\/span><\/p>\n<h1><strong>Give Homeowners Visibility, Too<\/strong><\/h1>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Your customers can benefit from the same tools that give <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">you<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> a peek at what your service providers are doing. For example, Uber-style tracking shows homeowners when the service provider will arrive, and access to the service provider\u2019s bio and photo helps the customer feel safe when the service provider shows up at their door.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Visibility is crucial for improving your company\u2019s customer service. But if your data is in silos with walls between your organization, your service partners, and your customers, visibility is all but impossible.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-13514\" src=\"https:\/\/dispatch.me\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/01\/How-Are-Your-3rd-Party-Contractors-Doing-Here\u2019s-How-to-Find-Out-1.png\" alt=\"How Are Your 3rd-Party Contractors Doing?
