It was a spectacle of an event&#8230;from industry influencers to some of the world\u2019s largest franchise brands. What made the event impressive were the breakout and round-table sessions. Conversations ranged from employee motivation to the future of franchising; however, one theme that everyone talked about was the idea of automation. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Everyone wanted to know how to become an automated franchise. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">They wanted to know how it would enhance their franchise and make their brand more memorable. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In response to this theme, we\u2019re breaking down how automation can affect your service franchise in two critical ways. <\/span><\/p>\n<h2>Automation improves customer communication<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For any service franchise, your brand is held entirely in the eyes of the beholder. Meaning you don\u2019t decide what your brand is, your customer does. If you don\u2019t follow-up with a customer, they\u2019ll view your communication as poor and most-likely voice their opinion on Yelp &#8211; letting others know about your \u201cbad\u201d brand. \u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you send consistent notifications and frequently call them to let them know that their appointment is still on, then you\u2019ll be seen as transparent and competent &#8211; this time boosting your brand perception. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><strong>Service Franchise Tip:<\/strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Being customer-centric is the best way to build brand loyalty and trust. But, keeping your customer in the middle is also&#8230;EXHAUSTING. This is where automation comes in. Having a platform that can automate your most important customer communication touchpoints can save you time and energy &#8211; all while boosting your NPS and brand loyalty.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Time spent waiting for in-home services and appointments cost American workers $37.7 billion (<\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">IBOPE Zogby, 2011) &#8211; <\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With automation, n<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">o longer will customers have to feel that &#8220;hopeless&#8221; and &#8220;left in the dark&#8221; feeling when interacting with a service franchise.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><center><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-6104\" src=\"https:\/\/dipatchmestage.wpengine.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/02\/New-Dispatch-Family-1024x574.png\" alt=\"Dispatch \" width=\"600\" height=\"336\" srcset=\"https:\/\/dispatch.me\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/02\/New-Dispatch-Family-1024x574.png 1024w, https:\/\/dispatch.me\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/02\/New-Dispatch-Family-300x168.png 300w, https:\/\/dispatch.me\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/02\/New-Dispatch-Family-768x430.png 768w, https:\/\/dispatch.me\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/02\/New-Dispatch-Family-1536x861.png 1536w, https:\/\/dispatch.me\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/02\/New-Dispatch-Family-2048x1148.png 2048w, https:\/\/dispatch.me\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/02\/New-Dispatch-Family-1444x809.png 1444w, https:\/\/dispatch.me\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/02\/New-Dispatch-Family-500x280.png 500w, https:\/\/dispatch.me\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/02\/New-Dispatch-Family-660x370.png 660w, https:\/\/dispatch.me\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/02\/New-Dispatch-Family-380x213.png 380w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" \/><\/center><\/p>\n<h2>Automation provides 24\/7 visibility<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Knowing what is going on with your franchises is difficult. Depending on how your franchise organization is set up, your franchisees can operate as fully-independent businesses or rather, as part of your larger network. This sometimes leads to franchisors not always knowing what is going on with their franchises &#8211; which is precisely why the need for automation is real. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When you equip your franchisees with the digital tools to automate their customer communication, you gain real-time information about how each branch is performing. You can know how they&#8217;re communicating with the customer, if they\u2019re regularly informing their customers of ETAs, and if the customer is messaging and sending photos to the franchise. Once all this customer communication is centralized into one platform, then you as the franchisor can gain valuable insight into your entire franchise network.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><center><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-6107\" src=\"https:\/\/dipatchmestage.wpengine.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/02\/Customer-Experience-Phones-1024x302.png\" alt=\"Customer Experience Phones\" width=\"600\" height=\"177\" srcset=\"https:\/\/dispatch.me\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/02\/Customer-Experience-Phones-1024x302.png 1024w, https:\/\/dispatch.me\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/02\/Customer-Experience-Phones-300x89.png 300w, https:\/\/dispatch.me\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/02\/Customer-Experience-Phones-768x227.png 768w, https:\/\/dispatch.me\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/02\/Customer-Experience-Phones-1536x454.png 1536w, https:\/\/dispatch.me\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/02\/Customer-Experience-Phones-2048x605.png 2048w, https:\/\/dispatch.me\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/02\/Customer-Experience-Phones-1444x426.png 1444w, https:\/\/dispatch.me\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/02\/Customer-Experience-Phones-500x148.png 500w, https:\/\/dispatch.me\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/02\/Customer-Experience-Phones-840x248.png 840w, https:\/\/dispatch.me\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/02\/Customer-Experience-Phones-380x112.png 380w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" \/><\/center>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><strong>Service Franchise Tip:<\/strong> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The fastest way to gain 24\/7 visibility is to provide your franchise network with a digital platform that can automate customer touchpoints.
