If you choose to implement these best practices, you\u2019ll be able to effectively leverage your 3rd-party contractor network and better serve your customers.<\/p>\n<h2>Part 1: The Challenges Associated with Managing 3rd-Party Contractors<\/h2>\n<p>The common issue that many service companies face is around compliance. Your 3rd-party contractors, by definition, are independent contractors, not full-time employees (FTEs). They run their own businesses, which offers you both benefits and challenges. With your FTEs, you can train them on your processes, monitor the quality of their service, incentivize them to improve, and hold them accountable in various ways (up to termination) when they don\u2019t meet expectations.<\/p>\n<p>With your 3rd party network, you have much less visibility into what they are doing at the customer\u2019s home, and you don\u2019t have data or tools to track\/monitor their performance. Thus, you really can\u2019t use incentives as effectively as with your FTEs to ensure accountability for sub-standard service delivery. In the absence of performance-related data about your 3rd party network, and with the resulting impossibility of incentivizing performance that you can\u2019t even track, how can you ensure that your customers are getting a great service your brand demands?<\/p>\n<p>The answer, of course, is that you can\u2019t. You can\u2019t improve or optimize a 3rd party contractor\u2019s performance, which puts your quality and customer experience at risk. You can\u2019t resolve customer problems that you don\u2019t even know about. You can\u2019t optimize processes and practices when you don\u2019t have real-time data and communication regarding your 3rd-party network. So let\u2019s explore solutions.<\/p>\n<h2>Part 2: Best Practices for Effectively Managing Your 3rd-Party Network<\/h2>\n<p>As any plumber will tell you, you need the right tools for the job. That\u2019s also certainly true about managing your 3rd-party network. To do the job right, you need something that will help you connect in real-time to your 3rd party network, giving you visibility into performance data and how well each contractor is performing. Communication, relevant data, transparency, convenience for you, your contractor, and your customer&#8230;that\u2019s what it\u2019s all about.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2>5 practical tips for managing your 3rd-party network<\/h2>\n<h3><strong>Integration with a mobile app<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>To manage your 3rd party network, you need a simple application that is accessible anywhere, anytime, and over any device. The point is to seamlessly connect the three most important parties &#8212; \u00a0home service enterprises, 3rd party contractors, and homeowners\/customers.<\/p>\n<p>We live in a digitally connected economy, where more and more services and customer experiences are delivered through digitally-enabled experience. This solution is also the answer for home service too, especially in managing your 3rd party network.<\/p>\n<h3><strong>Give your 3rd-party contractors an easy-to-use digital tool for greater productivity<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>Enterprises that leverage 3rd-party contractors yearn,\u00a0for one thing, visibility into the performance of their entire network. However, the mere fact that they\u2019re leveraging 3rd-party contractors makes it nearly impossible to manage this. UNLESS the enterprise is using a platform like Dispatch. The Dispatch mobile app is a simple, yet powerful application that allows any service provider to manage their own retail work and jobs\/leads they receive from other sources. This enables them to deliver memorable customer experiences while streamlining their communication and status updates back to the enterprise. \u00a0Having automatic status updates sent directly back to the enterprise saves 3rd-party contractors on average 3 hours a day.<\/p>\n<h3><strong>Give homeowners an easy and convenient app-free experience<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>Whenever we tell people that we connect the enterprise, 3rd-party contractor, and homeowner together, the typical response we get back is, \u201cSo you make homeowners download an app?\u201d If we tried to make homeowners download an app, we wouldn\u2019t get anyone to do so &#8211; thus rendering the platform useless. So, to get around that, we offer an app-free experience for homeowners. \u00a0Your customers will get a simple-to-use web-based link that enables them to go to their web browser and interact fully with the 3rd-party contractor. They can communicate, take photos, leave notes, and provide as much detail to the contractor as possible to make sure they\u2019re informed and aware of their issue. As customer experiences go, it\u2019s hard to make things easier, more convenient, and more accessible than this.<\/p>\n<h3><strong>Give your 3rd-party contractor a single portal to manage all their lead\/job sources as well as their retail work<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>All home service enterprises know the low compliance rates for 3rd party contractors. They know that getting status updates is tedious and ensuring betting compliance takes time.<\/p>\n<p>Your 3rd-party network doesn\u2019t access and reports their status via your portal because doing so is the very definition of inconvenience. They don\u2019t want to log into four portals to update eight jobs. They\u2019d rather be out\u00a0in the field doing what they do best &#8211; fixing homeowner problems.<\/p>\n<p>Dispatch allows contractors to provide status updates on all their jobs, \u00a0automatically. No matter where that job source comes from, the status updates are automatically sent back to the enterprise, helping the contractor improve their compliance and reliability.<\/p>\n<h3><strong>Get real-time performance feedback<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>Real-time performance data from your 3rd-party technician lets you solve the \u201ccommand and control\u201d problem discussed in part one, enabling you to work with contractors as if they were FTEs. The impact that a service logistics platform has on service quality is massive: When a 3rd-party contractor uses Dispatch, they deliver the following:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>74% scheduling compliance<\/strong><\/li>\n<li><strong>35% increase in NPS<\/strong><\/li>\n<li><strong>86% reduction in no-shows<\/strong><\/li>\n<li><strong>37% decrease in outbound call volume<\/strong><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>The time of \u201cflying blind\u201d with your 3rd-party network is over. You can now have full visibility and collect data-driven insights to effectively manage your 3rd-party contractors as if they&#8217;re full-time-employees.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>In part one of this post, we\u2019ll briefly explain the challenges of managing your 3rd-party network.
