People tend to tell everyone they know when they\u2019ve had a bad experience with a company\u2014and the longer you wait to respond to an unhappy customer, the more opportunity they have to tell their friends, family, and social media all about it. And the whole time, that customer is getting more upset by your radio silence. This means responding quickly can stop a wave of negativity before it starts.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Worried you could be missing negative <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/dispatch.me\/4-customer-experience-trends-home-service-brands-should-follow-in-2020\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">customer experiences<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">? Dispatch alerts you instantly when customers leave negative reviews, so you can respond and resolve those problems immediately.<\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/learn.dispatch.me\/demo-request\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u00a0<\/span><\/a><\/p>\n<h2><strong>Customer Support Tip #2<br \/>\nOffer a Solution<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Upset customers may say all kinds of negative things about your business in their review\u2014even things that aren\u2019t true or are only partly true. Resist the temptation to rush in and defend your brand or your service provider. Instead of meeting frustration with more frustration, focus on resolving the problem by finding a solution.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/dispatch.me\/solutions\/by-need\/visibility\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Check your service provider\u2019s notes<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> for why things broke down with this customer. Then look to the review to see what you can do to make things right; the customer may describe what result they\u2019re looking for, making your job easier.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If they don\u2019t, leave a reply asking them to provide further information on the review site, or to get in touch with your company directly. And if they ask for something you can\u2019t give, look for an alternative solution. Even if it\u2019s not exactly what the customer wants, it may satisfy them that you\u2019re trying to fix the issue.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Above all, don\u2019t make promises you can\u2019t keep, and don\u2019t leave a public reply with a solution for one customer that you\u2019re not willing to provide for all customers. From your customer\u2019s point of view, the problem they\u2019re steamed about might already be a case of over-promising and under-delivering, so you don\u2019t want to cement that image of your company in their mind. Whatever solutions you offer, make sure you can deliver on them\u2014for <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">everyone<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> if yours is a public response!<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><strong>Customer Support Tip #3<br \/>\nShow Appreciation<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">New Voice Media says the number one reason customers switch to a new brand is that<\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.vonage.com\/business\/perspectives\/the-62-billion-customer-service-scared-away-infographic\/\"> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">they feel underappreciated<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. And for many customers, the way you handle their complaints has a huge impact on whether they feel valued\u2014or ignored.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Don\u2019t just say, \u201cI\u2019m sorry\u201d to a customer who has left a bad review. Use your apology as another chance to show you understand their issue, and to show appreciation for their business. Here\u2019s a better way to apologize: \u201cI\u2019m sorry you were inconvenienced when the service provider didn\u2019t arrive as scheduled. Thank you for giving me a chance to come up with a solution for you.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><strong>Customer Support Tip #4<br \/>\nFollow Up<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Remember how important it is to make your customers feel appreciated? One way to do that is to follow up with them a day or two after you\u2019ve responded to their review to make sure they\u2019re still satisfied with the solution you offered (and that the solution has been delivered).<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This extra step shows your customer you haven\u2019t washed your hands of them as soon as you responded to their complaint. Even those who weren\u2019t entirely satisfied with the solution you were able to offer may think of you more charitably if you show you\u2019re still thinking of their experience.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-14473 \" src=\"https:\/\/dispatch.me\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/02\/Five-Tips-for-Handling-Negative-Customer-Reviews1.png\" alt=\"Five Tips for Handling Negative Customer Reviews\" width=\"600\" height=\"281\" srcset=\"https:\/\/dispatch.me\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/02\/Five-Tips-for-Handling-Negative-Customer-Reviews1.png 953w, https:\/\/dispatch.me\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/02\/Five-Tips-for-Handling-Negative-Customer-Reviews1-300x140.png 300w, https:\/\/dispatch.me\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/02\/Five-Tips-for-Handling-Negative-Customer-Reviews1-768x359.png 768w, https:\/\/dispatch.me\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/02\/Five-Tips-for-Handling-Negative-Customer-Reviews1-500x234.png 500w, https:\/\/dispatch.me\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/02\/Five-Tips-for-Handling-Negative-Customer-Reviews1-791x370.png 791w, https:\/\/dispatch.me\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/02\/Five-Tips-for-Handling-Negative-Customer-Reviews1-380x178.png 380w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" \/><\/p>\n<h2><strong>Customer Support Tip #5<br \/>\nTrack Complaints<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To reduce the number of negative reviews you receive, you need to address problems before they become widespread. Document every customer complaint you receive and compile that data so you can look for patterns and trouble spots.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For example, if a certain part of the buying process tends to result in more customer complaints than others, look for ways to streamline the process or make it easier for customers to navigate. Or maybe your customers have trouble communicating with your third-party service providers.<\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/dispatch.me\/solutions\/by-need\/customer-experience\/\"> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Facilitate that communication<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> so your providers can better serve customers.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Negative customer feedback is one of the more stressful parts of running a business.
