From its early days, the company has embodied a culture of diligent written documentation to help understand how happy their customers are.<\/p>\n<p>Every task that has ever been done at Brendan\u2019s company comes with a thorough paper trail\u2013from customer surveys and job details, to design specs and invoices.<\/p>\n<p>Of course, none of this data is actually helpful.<\/p>\n<p>For all the time Brendan\u2019s team puts into record keeping, they still face massive information holes. Complicating matters further\u2013and like most in his industry\u2013Brendan employs a 3rd-party network of independent home service contractors to install and repair their home equipment. That means his field techs can knock on the door of a customer in the morning, and by the afternoon be on a separate job, for a completely different company\u2013and Brendan\u2019s team has no way of accurately tracking just how well their 3rd-party contractors performed when they were on the clock. If a customer is unhappy because something his 3rd-party contractor did, odds are they won\u2019t call to say anything. And if the customer is unhappy, they MAY call you, or they may just take their thoughts online and leave a negative review.<\/p>\n<h1><strong>Cross-eyed<\/strong><\/h1>\n<p>Before the digital age, there was this preconceived notion that a company\u2019s reputation was largely left in doubt, that time spent trying to manage one\u2019s brand was like shooting in the dark, or throwing spaghetti against the wall.<\/p>\n<p>Sure, companies like Brendan\u2019s would TRY to collect customer feedback information or contractor performance reviews, but their attempts were often futile. The \u201cdata\u201d that these companies collated represented past projects, past customer complaints, and past everything. Every day they had to answer the same questions:<\/p>\n<ul style=\"margin:0;padding:0;\">\n<li>How do we fix today\u2019s problems, so that they won\u2019t happen tomorrow?<\/li>\n<li>How do we properly measure our 3rd-party contractor performance?<\/li>\n<li>How do we track a lead from our site all the way to after a job is complete?<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>C-level executives like Brendan were being asked to play part history detective, part shaman\u2013with one eye on the past, and the other on both the present and the future.<\/p>\n<h1><strong>Enter Technology: Better Job Details, Better Chance for 5-Star Ratings<\/strong><\/h1>\n<p>Today, Brendan is leveraging a modern service experience platform to solve tomorrow\u2019s problems before they even arise.<\/p>\n<p>He has paired his +30 years of OEM experience with powerful technology, to help him measure and predict the KPIs that matter most to his customers.<\/p>\n<p>By providing his 3rd-party contractors with modern customer experience tools, Brendan is able to track and measure important KPIs that are attributed to exemplary, 5-star customer experiences. Using this technology, his team can predict which factors in a given project will trigger high customer satisfaction scores\u2013and then act on that information proactively. All of the company\u2019s customer data is updated in real-time, allowing them to better control their brand\u2019s reputation, and never leaving it in doubt. That\u2019s actionable data today, accurately forecasted for tomorrow.<\/p>\n<h1><strong>Who\u2019s on Deck?<\/strong><\/h1>\n<p>So much of a 5-star customer experience can depend upon the field technician\u2019s preparation and expertise for the job at hand.<\/p>\n<p>Many of Brendan\u2019s best field techs took time to grow their skills. They didn\u2019t arrive at their first job site knowing all the answers to every problem. The tricky part for Brendan was always determining which techs were best equipped for a home service call at that exact moment in time. For example, when his main HVAC guy couldn\u2019t make it to a job, Brendan would have to \u201croll the dice\u201d and select his best #2 based on little to no performance data.<\/p>\n<p>Obviously, that wasn\u2019t the best way to manage a 3rd-Party network, nor help his contractors grow their skills.<\/p>\n<h1><strong>Batter Up<\/strong><\/h1>\n<p>Just like Dispatch helps Brendan predict the right KPIs for the best customer experience, they also help him predict which of his contractors will perform well on a particular job, based on their skill set and past performance.<\/p>\n<p>Tracking and analyzing all of his contractors\u2019 performance data in one user-friendly platform makes Brendan\u2019s life easier, and the company\u2019s work more transparent. Brendan can now optimize his roster of contractors, selecting which field tech is best prepared for the job that day, like a big league ball club tweaking the lineup to put his best on the field.<\/p>\n<h1><strong>Unlock Your Data and Grow Your Enterprise<\/strong><\/h1>\n<p>If you run an OEM enterprise, there is still no excuse to not understand how well your third-party contractor network is performing in real-time and how happy your customers are.  There is just too much high-powered, dependable technology out there to ignore.
