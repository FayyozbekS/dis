Rudberg most recently led technology teams at both Passkey and Zipcar and brings a wealth of experience to this newly created role at Dispatch.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Scott is joining at the perfect time, as we grow the team and increase our focus on building an adaptive platform for the most iconic brands in the home services industry,\u201d said Dispatch CEO and founder, Avi Goldberg. He has a successful history of simplifying complex networks, and that&#8217;s one of the core value drivers leading to our success in the industry.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>As the home services industry relies more on flexible and non-dedicated service providers, the market is looking for technology to help bridge the gap between the enterprise and its 3rd-party contractors. Dispatch closes that gap by partnering with customer-centric brands seeking better visibility, higher efficiency, and consistently positive customer experiences.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Dispatch is setting a new standard for what brands can achieve across their field networks \u2013 in terms of network effectiveness, network engagement and customer experience,&#8221; said Rudberg. &#8220;I am excited to lead some of the best engineers and product managers in the technology space as we realize that mission.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Rudberg was previously Vice President of Technology at Zipcar, Inc. and served as Senior Vice President of Product Strategy at Passkey International, Inc.. He has over 18 years\u2019 experience managing the development of software products and systems, with over 9 years developing web-based solutions for the Meetings and Hospitality Industry. Rudberg received a B.S. in Electrical Engineering from Tufts University and an MBA from Babson College&#8217;s Olin Graduate School of Business.<\/p>\n<h1><strong>ABOUT DISPATCH<\/strong><\/h1>\n<p>Dispatch, headquartered in Boston, is one of the leading software companies in America.
