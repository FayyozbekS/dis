First, you need to find the right ones. Then, you need to keep them. Seems simple enough, but with your competitors trying to do the same thing, and customer expectations steadily rising, working with your third-party network can become a significant challenge. In addressing this challenge, however, lies an opportunity.<\/span><\/p>\n<h4>An Extension of Your Brand<\/h4>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The sometimes-hard truth is that cultivating a network of efficient, experienced pros that participate in your preferred programs and do work on your behalf is your best opportunity to drive lifelong customer loyalty. As far as your customer is concerned, <\/span><b>every interaction with your network is an interaction with your brand<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. If your pro is friendly, reliable, and hard-working, then the deck, siding, windows, or garage door they\u2019re installing will be as well. That translates into customer loyalty.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Every touchpoint between your network and your customer is an opportunity to build that loyalty and trust. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.mckinsey.com\/~\/media\/mckinsey\/business%20functions\/mckinsey%20digital\/our%20insights\/introducing%20the%20next-generation%20operating%20model\/introducing-the-next-gen-operating-model.ashx\">According to McKinsey<\/a>, companies with above average customer satisfaction scores can earn up to 300% more than laggards in the same space. Since your network is an extension of your brand, it stands to reason that making sure your network is always putting your best foot forward is not only important &#8211; it\u2019s essential.<\/span><\/p>\n<h4>Preferential Treatment<\/h4>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So you want the best pros, and you want them to participate in your preferred pro programs. This tried-and-true approach to finding and keeping the best possible pros is mutually beneficial &#8211; you know that the person walking into your customer\u2019s home is going to represent you well, and will recommend your brand whenever possible. Your pros know that they\u2019re getting the highest level of support and attention from the brands they sell and use for their projects.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In this way, <\/span><b>pro loyalty and customer loyalty go hand-in-hand<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. The more you do for your pros, the more you do for your customers. If you provide them a solution they can use to run their business, and seamlessly work with yours, you give them a pretty good reason to stick around, and sing your praises.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Your customer is probably going to one of your dealers or a big-box retailer to see and feel your product; to decide if it\u2019s right for their needs. Once they do that, they\u2019re probably going to your website to find the right pro to do their job. You need to be confident in the preferred pros that are being featured on your website. Building a strong preferred pro program is the best way to ensure your customers are getting the right experience, so giving your pros the right tools and incentives to keep them engaged with your brand is the best way to drive loyalty.<\/span><\/p>\n<h4>A Rising Tide Lifts All Ships<\/h4>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Luckily there is a solution out there that is built from the ground up to accommodate this model. Dispatch is a platform for home service brands that rely on independent service providers to build lifelong customer loyalty through delivering the best products and the best services<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Dispatch can be part of your preferred pro program, offering your network powerful tools they can use to do your jobs as well as their own, while providing you with visibility into their performance. Again, it\u2019s mutually beneficial &#8211; your pros get something that helps them improve their operations, and you get the insights you need to cultivate that perfect network, and ensure your customers are getting an experience that accurately reflects your brand.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Your customers improve their homes, your pros improve their business, and you improve your brand reputation.
