This partnership will enable FieldEdge users to interact with Dispatch customers directly in the FieldEdge interface, providing valuable insights on real-time actions to data-driven enterprises. In a statement, Dispatch CEO Avi Goldberg praised their newest partner, saying that FieldEdge \u201cessentially invented field service technology more than 35 years ago; their team is one of the most innovative groups out there. Pairing our platform with FieldEdge\u2019s technology is a major win, especially for contractors and homeowners.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>After powering millions of customer interactions in over 30% of the homes in America, the visibility that Dispatch provides into field operations has helped customer-centric enterprise brands reduce their customer no-show rate by 86%, increase their NPS by 35%, and lower their \u201cWhere\u2019s my tech?\u201d calls by 37%. As more home service brands look for competitive advantages, they\u2019re turning to Dispatch to drive both higher customer lifetime value and lower operational expenses &#8212; leading to significant gains in operating margin.<\/p>\n<p>FieldEdge has accomplished many firsts in its industry, bringing the first service management software to the market in 1980 and releasing the first electronic dispatch board in the mid-90s. As the leading provider of field service solutions, FieldEdge has helped customers reduce time spent on dispatching and scheduling by 50%. In addition, FieldEdge\u2019s real-time QuickBooks integration streamlines the accounting process so contractors have more time to focus on the core business needs such as employee retention, recruiting and growing their customer base.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThe Dispatch Gateway with FieldEdge will help contractors better communicate with enterprises and homeowners \u00a0&#8212; with appointment reminders, status updates, and customer experience surveys, all of which will give FieldEdge users a competitive advantage on performance and customer satisfaction,\u201d said Dispatch Head of Customer Engagement Sam Crowell Richard. With the Gateway, FieldEdge users will be able to automatically receive and return work orders from the warranty companies, manufacturers, lead generators, and other field service enterprises that Dispatch serves. Additionally, FieldEdge users will receive their own customizable booking page linked to FieldEdge, enabling lead capture 24\/7\/365.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cFieldEdge is laser-focused on giving its users the best possible tools so that they can be the best home service providers in the business,\u201d Goldberg continued. \u201cOur Gateway strategy is about opening up our platform to the world\u2019s leading field service technology providers. Ultimately, that benefits the customer and the contractor by facilitating simple, seamless experiences. That makes our two missions very aligned.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWith the seamless Dispatch Gateway, we are equipping contractors with the resources necessary to bring in qualified leads and book more jobs directly within the FieldEdge software,\u201d said Connie Certusi, President of FieldEdge, \u201cThe joint efforts between Dispatch and FieldEdge have allowed us to offer our customers a new, innovative integration experience.
