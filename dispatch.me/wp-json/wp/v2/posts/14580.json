Reassure customers that your service professional is disinfecting tools and equipment between visits, and ask that they provide access to a sink and soap.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Finally, take care of as much of the transaction as possible outside the customer\u2019s home. That includes the initial conversations about the work and any paperwork required (more on that shortly).<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Assess everyone&#8217;s health before <strong>rolling trucks<\/strong><\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While COVID-19 can be asymptomatic, there are some signs you can look for to reduce the chance of spreading it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ask your service providers to notify you if they have any cold or flu symptoms, especially a cough, fatigue, or fever. Any service provider showing these symptoms should stay home, along with any service provider who\u2019s been in contact with a person who tests positive.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Before sending a service professional to your customer\u2019s home, ask if anyone in the house is sick. And make it clear to your service team that they can and should ask the same question once they arrive. If anyone in the home is sick, service providers should check with supervisors to assess whether the work can be rescheduled.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Innovate with <strong>Contactless Communication<\/strong><\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Your goal should be to limit coronavirus exposure between your field service providers and customers. Leveraging tools with robust messaging capabilities can help you accomplish that task.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A platform that allows text messaging (or even better, video), can help you diagnose the problem before rolling a truck. Connecting virtually before the job ensures technicians arrive with all required parts and tools, meaning fewer exposures between the shop and the customer\u2019s home and less time disinfecting tools<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You can also reduce the chances of infection by improving the way your customer signs off on the job once it\u2019s complete. Instead of a signature on paper, send a confirmation email or ask them to confirm via your app or website. Offer digital payment methods so paper checks don\u2019t have to change hands.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We hope these minor adjustments help your process and workflow as we all continue navigating work-related changes because of COVID-19. Additionally. your work is ensuring homes are safe and comfortable and that is something that homeowners will forever be thankful for.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Need a little tech help with implementing contactless communication?
