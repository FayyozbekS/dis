Before-You-Begin <strong>Costs<\/strong><\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Before you even start the actual software development, you will have time costs associated with your project. One of the first (and, arguably, the most important) is nailing down a general budget.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This also tends to be one of the more difficult costs to determine, according to consulting firm McKinsey. Their research found that<\/span> <a href=\"https:\/\/www.mckinsey.com\/business-functions\/mckinsey-digital\/our-insights\/delivering-large-scale-it-projects-on-time-on-budget-and-on-value\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">the average large-scale IT project runs a whopping 45%<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> over budget\u2014and 7% over time. Some of the reasons they cited for these overruns were unclear objectives, an unprepared team, and unrealistic schedules.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You can mitigate some of these issues by hiring a business analyst or product manager, which is the second hidden cost of your software development journey.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you don\u2019t already have this person on your team, it\u2019ll take time to hire someone competent to fill this role. The phrase \u201ctime is money\u201d became a clich\u00e9 for a reason\u2014all of the time you invest in hiring a project manager is time taken away from your other business projects and goals. On top of that is the time for the onboarding and training your new hire will need.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While you\u2019re thinking about hiring, you\u2019ll also have to add developers to your team. This can be a pricey proposition, especially if you need multiple new employees to build your enterprise software &#8211; not to mention the salaries associated with each hire.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">2. Planning <strong>Costs<\/strong><\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Your next big chunk of costs involves all of your planning activities before the actual development begins. You\u2019ll need time to decide on the most important business objectives (what you want your new software to actually do), the technical requirements to get there, and a blueprint for what that solution will look like.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Once you\u2019ve got your goals and a blueprint, your developers need to<\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/searchsoftwarequality.techtarget.com\/definition\/Scrum-sprint\"> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">build out sprints for the project<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. Each sprint requires a planning meeting between you and your developers to decide what work will be done in the time period defined by the sprint. The number of sprints and the length of each depends on what you need your software to do for you, but even for small projects the time needed to plan them adds up.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">3. Project Management <strong>Costs<\/strong><\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Now that you\u2019ve got the project and sprints defined, a product manager on board, and developers to actually build your enterprise software, you can just let them get to work, right?<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Not exactly. Project management can be a time-consuming process on its own. You\u2019ll have to manage your developers to ensure they get work done on schedule, make sure all development teams are communicating and collaborating effectively, analyze past sprints and plan new ones, and put project monitoring processes in place.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">4. Project Development <strong>Costs<\/strong><\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Once your software is nearing its finished stage, a new set of time-intensive costs pop up. First, you\u2019ll have to put your software through a quality assurance process. Your team should be doing regular QA tests throughout the development process to avoid last-minute disasters, but you\u2019ll still have to sink some time into testing the final (or near-final) version before releasing it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If your QA testing reveals bugs, you\u2019ll have added time costs for fixing them. Finally, before actually handing your software over to end-users, you\u2019ll have to perform an audit to make sure it meets security and compliance requirements.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">5. Training <strong>Costs<\/strong><\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You can\u2019t just hand your software to your users and let them figure it out on their own. Everyone will need training, from your end-users to your tech support team. That means developing training materials (either written documentation or e-learning courses).<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When your materials are finished, you\u2019ll have to provide time for your users to learn the new system\u2014which means staff costs that aren\u2019t going to the regular operation of your business. Depending on the complexity of your new software (and how many hours your employees need to learn it), those costs can be steep. Not quite parallel to this situation but still enlightening, <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Training Magazine<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u2019s 2017 Training Industry Report found that small businesses<\/span> <a href=\"https:\/\/trainingmag.com\/trgmag-article\/2017-training-industry-report\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">spend between $1,100 and $1,886<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> to train new employees for 36 to 43 hours. That translates to $30 to $43 per hour.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">6. Troubleshooting and Support <strong>Costs<\/strong><\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When you build your own software, you\u2019re also on the hook for any ongoing tech support required to deal with new bugs and troubleshooting. Just about any software solution has its own unique set of bugs (and, yes, user errors) that appear regularly.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Beyond the regular troubleshooting time, your IT team will also have to collaborate with your developers to fix these recurring issues in the next iteration of the software (which starts the sprint process all over). They also will have to consider operational costs &#8211; monitoring, care and feeding of databases and storage systems, etc.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">7. Maintenance <strong>Costs<\/strong><\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So, you\u2019ve got your shiny new enterprise software built, your end-users and support staff have been trained, and your teams are collaborating to keep up with bugs. All done, right?<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">No again. Maintenance tasks\u2014like patches and upgrades\u2014can add up, too. Your developer team will have to spend time creating these patches and new versions of the software, while your IT staff spends time implementing and troubleshooting them. Additionally, new security vulnerabilities will need to be mitigated as it pertains to both patches but also the software packages used.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">8. Bonus: Opportunity <strong>Cost<\/strong><\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">All of the costs related to building your own enterprise software can add up fast, especially if your solution needs to be complex and integrate with a lot of existing systems.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But one cost a lot of businesses may not think about is the hit to the core business. While you\u2019re involved with planning and setting up this new software\u2014which can take months\u2014you\u2019re not as focused on your overall business goals and opportunities.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you\u2019ve got a great business analyst and project manager, the cost here may be minimal. But if you\u2019re really involved with the software production and launch, you may miss other potential areas of growth, which can set your business back.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Case for Buying Instead of <strong>Building Enterprise Software<\/strong><\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The cost of a purchased software solution may look enormous at first. But when you think about all of the staff time and management\/IT costs that go into building your own software, a purchased solution looks a lot more attractive.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With purchased enterprise software, you don\u2019t have the headaches involved with meeting development deadlines, creating your own training materials, or monitoring software health and creating patches and updates. With those issues in mind, a purchased software solution becomes more budget-friendly.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Looking for a software solution to keep your company, third-party service providers, and customers on the same page?<\/span> <a href=\"https:\/\/dispatch.me\/request-a-demo\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Schedule a Dispatch demo<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> to learn more.<\/span><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Thinking about building your own enterprise-level field service management software?
