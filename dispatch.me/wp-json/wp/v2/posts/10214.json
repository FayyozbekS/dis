Simons most recently was Vice President for Oracle, leading its field service team across North America. Prior to that Simons led the sales team for TOA Technologies, a classic field service solution acquired by Oracle. \u201cRob is well qualified to accelerate Dispatch\u2019s partnership with customer-centric enterprises,\u201d said Dispatch CEO Avi Goldberg. \u201cHe knows the space well and he\u2019s excited about Dispatch\u2019s unique approach to decentralized field services. We are delighted to have him on the team.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Joining as Head of Human Capital is <strong>Jenn Ramcharan<\/strong>, who brings significant talent and HR experience to the newly-created role within Dispatch. Ramcharan has focused on software and technology (TripAdvisor, Pixability, Disruptor Beam) in a career spanning over 15 years, and brings a diverse skill set to the Dispatch team. \u201cJenn has founded companies. But most importantly, she\u2019s a great people leader,\u201d CFO David Morland said. \u201cAs we continue to grow, we need to stay true to our mission and our culture, and Jenn knows how to make that happen.\u201d Ramcharan attended Florida A&amp;M University.<\/p>\n<p>Finally, has accepted the role as Head of Marketing. Hadlow has a deep and varied strategy and marketing background, having held leadership positions at high-growth digital companies, such as Charlotte-based Red Ventures and Boston-based MyMove.com. He most recently oversaw the Go-to-Market strategies for multiple companies in his role within the operating group at private equity firm Berkshire Partners. \u201cCharlie is the best person to tell our story to the marketplace. On top of that, he has been a CEO himself and will be a huge asset to me, the management team, and Dispatch employees,\u201d Goldberg said.<\/p>\n<p>The home services industry continues to shift toward a more flexible and non-dedicated service provider network. The company is positioned well in that relationship because they partner with customer-centric brands seeking better visibility, higher efficiency, and consistent positive customer experiences from their third-party network. \u201cDispatch is sitting on a gold mine of data, and already has both the integrations and customer-focused orientation that sets brand partners apart in this industry,\u201d said Hadlow. \u201cThe opportunity was too exciting to pass up.\u201d<\/p>\n<h1><strong>ABOUT DISPATCH<\/strong><\/h1>\n<p>Dispatch, headquartered in Boston, is one of the leading software companies in America.
