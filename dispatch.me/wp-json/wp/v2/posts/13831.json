Here are the most important CX (customer service) trends to watch in 2020.<\/span><\/p>\n<h1><strong>Home service customers want to communicate on their terms.<\/strong><\/h1>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Not so long ago, field service businesses could get away with just using the phone (and maybe email) to keep in touch with customers.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Now, those same customers live in a more connected world, with smartphones at their fingertips and mobile apps for just about everything. They expect their favorite brands to connect with them on <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">their<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> terms\u2014wherever and however they prefer to be engaged. Salesforce found that 40% of customers will find a different company if they can\u2019t use their preferred channels.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-full wp-image-13833 aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/dispatch.me\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/01\/4-Customer-Experience-Trends-Home-Brands-Need-to-Follow-in-2020-1.png\" alt=\"4 Customer Experience Trends Home Brands Need to Follow in 2020\" width=\"600\" height=\"499\" \/><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What does that mean for your home service brand? In short, you need to meet your customers where they are. Offer job status updates via text. Provide a mobile app where customers can get instant updates and leave feedback when the job\u2019s complete. Create a <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/help.dispatch.me\/article\/437-customer-portal\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">web portal<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> where they can update job details, upload photos for service professionals to review before their visit and communicate easily with your service team.<\/span><\/p>\n<h1><strong>Home service customers want to know who they\u2019re talking to.<\/strong><\/h1>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When customers visit your social media profiles, go to your website, or talk to your call center team, can they easily tell they\u2019re talking to the same company? Do they experience an easy transition between different touchpoints with you\u2014or are they running into roadblocks in the form of different silos separated by each department?<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>According to the Salesforce research, 59% of customers felt like they were talking to completely different companies as they got handed off to different departments.<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Instead of a smooth transition, many companies make their customers provide the same information to each new department, creating frustration that can send a customer searching for a new company to do business with.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Fixing this issue starts with taking a look at your various channels and creating a cohesive message and experience across all of them. You also need to give all of your team members\u2014across all departments\u2014access to centralized customer information so they can provide answers and take care of customer concerns efficiently.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Finally, make sure your third-party service providers are on the same page as you are. Even the greatest customer experience can fall apart if the final piece\u2014the actual <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/dipatchmestage.wpengine.com\/6-steps-for-creating-the-best-in-home-customer-experience\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">service provided in the home<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u2014doesn\u2019t meet their expectations.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/dipatchmestage.wpengine.com\/3rd-party-workforce\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Tracking what your third-party provider is doing<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> in the field will help you provide a smooth customer experience all the way through their journey with you. With up-to-the-minute progress reporting, you can keep your customers informed on when their service provider will arrive, keep track of how long service calls take and gather crucial data that will help you provide more efficient service on future calls.<\/span><\/p>\n<h1><strong>Home service customers want personalization<\/strong><\/h1>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Generic, one-size-fits-all messaging doesn\u2019t work anymore\u2014customers want their communication with your brand to be based on their <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/dipatchmestage.wpengine.com\/big-data-customer-experience-and-loyalty\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">individual needs and preferences<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.forbes.com\/sites\/bernardmarr\/2019\/10\/21\/the-6-customer-experience-cx-trends-every-company-must-get-ready-for-now\/#30ba9a9a6940\"><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Forbes<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> points out<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, gaining a deeper understanding of your customers lets you customize not only the <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">kind<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> of messaging, but <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">when<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> you deliver that messaging.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-13834\" src=\"https:\/\/dispatch.me\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/01\/4-Customer-Experience-Trends-Home-Brands-Need-to-Follow-in-2020-2.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"600\" height=\"499\" \/><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For service businesses, this could mean you\u2019re looking at trends in shopping habits for Millennials, compared to other age demographics. What kind of home does a millennial buy? What kinds (or brands) of appliances? How many of them use mobile devices, and how do they prefer to communicate with you? Using data like this, you can create highly personalized messaging and services to fit their needs.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>In Cisco\u2019s survey, 77% of digital natives expect businesses to personalize their customer experience.<\/h2>\n<h1><strong>Home service customers want shareable content<\/strong><\/h1>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When it comes to grabbing a modern customer\u2019s attention, interactivity is the name of the game.<\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.forbes.com\/sites\/forbesagencycouncil\/2019\/10\/03\/top-marketing-trends-for-2020\/#9d92e8b13d5d\"> <i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Forbes<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> reports<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> that 91% of customers are looking for more visual and interactive content from brands.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This kind of content keeps visitors on your website longer and is more shareable than, for example, plain text-based blog posts. More shares mean more awareness for your brand, which can translate into a big influx of new customers.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What does that visual content look like for service brands? Maybe it\u2019s a video that provides an entertaining look at the typical service call (or a comparison between your service and a competitor\u2019s). Or you might create an infographic explaining the benefits of your service, along with relevant statistics.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-13835\" src=\"https:\/\/dispatch.me\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/01\/4-Customer-Experience-Trends-Home-Brands-Need-to-Follow-in-2020-3.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"600\" height=\"499\" \/><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The key to creating shareable content is to make sure it also gives your customer information that helps them make a good buying decision, improve their service outcome, or take care of some other necessary task. Entertainment alone won\u2019t keep your customers coming back.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">These trends can be either exciting or daunting, depending on how much focus you\u2019ve put into customer experience so far.
