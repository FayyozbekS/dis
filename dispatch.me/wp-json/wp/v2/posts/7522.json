My fiance and I live in a tiny apartment (or glorified shoebox depending on how you see it) in the North End of Boston. Over the past 4-years, we have had our fair share of issues with the apartment. When something like this happens I call my landlord (who lives overseas) and tell him what needs to be fixed. He always responds with, \u201cOkay, just schedule a fix, pay for it, and take it off of rent.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>So I type \u201chome service repair\u201d into Google and find the highest-rated service company. After I call them and leave a message, I get a call back to schedule my appointment. At that moment, I realized that most service providers unknowingly neglect the most important thing about \u201chome service\u201d \u2013 the experience.<\/p>\n<p>So, to all service providers, OEMs, or any company that offers in-home service, please listen to this plea\u2026<\/p>\n<p>My blood doesn\u2019t boil because my pipes are leaking, my blood boils because of the moments between where I\u2019m left in the dark with little to no communication from the service companies. These moments are the \u201cexperiences\u201d that every home service company neglects \u2013 the hopeless minutes homeowners feel when waiting for the technician to arrive.<\/p>\n<p>Modern companies have noticed that we live in a customer-centric world and customers now expect to be kept in the loop about everything! They want to know:<\/p>\n<ul style=\"margin: 0; padding: 0;\">\n<li>Who is arriving?<\/li>\n<li>When will they be arriving?<\/li>\n<li>What do they look like?<\/li>\n<li>Can I leave feedback?<\/li>\n<li>Can I communicate with them ahead of time?<\/li>\n<li>Can I easily reschedule or cancel the appointment?<\/li>\n<li>Can I do everything on my phone?<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>With consumer expectations rising, it\u2019s time to demand more of your brand and deliver a modern customer experience.<\/p>\n<p>In this post, we break down how to turn those hopeless moments into tech-driven memorable experiences.<\/p>\n<h1><strong>Step 1: The moment a customer needs help<\/strong><\/h1>\n<p>Ask yourself this, how frustrating is it when companies make it difficult to schedule an appointment? You search for the \u201cbook now\u201d button only to realize that they don\u2019t have one. So you dial the dispatcher, wait for someone to call back, and schedule a time that most likely isn\u2019t built around your schedule but theirs. Nothing about this sounds like an optimal customer experience does it?<\/p>\n<p>The importance of customer experience in the age of instant gratification is now higher than ever.<\/p>\n<h1><strong>How to fix step 1:<\/strong><\/h1>\n<p>Simple. Build in a process that allows homeowners to schedule appointments with your company at a time and date that works best for them. Here\u2019s what you do \u2013 add a \u201cBook Now\u201d button that takes homeowners to a form where they can share details about their need, fill out their contact information, select the best days and times that work well for them, and easily send their service request with a click of a button.<\/p>\n<p>Then, and this is the most important part, the company sends the homeowner a text message confirming that they received the service request. This immediate communication lets the homeowner know that you have their best intentions in mind and you\u2019re on it. It adds a little bode of confidence in their mind that your brand has everything under control.<\/p>\n<h1><strong>Step 2: The moment the customer starts to feel left in the dark<\/strong><\/h1>\n<p>How annoying is it when you text someone a question and they don\u2019t get back for a few days? You start thinking \u2013 Are they mad at me? Was I too pushy? Why aren\u2019t they responding? The silence messes with your rationality and just like any other human being you craft a narrative that explains\/justifies their silence \u2013 often based on zero evidence.<\/p>\n<p>The same goes for service companies. When I schedule an appointment and don\u2019t hear anything from the company for a while, I begin thinking:<\/p>\n<ul style=\"margin: 0; padding: 0;\">\n<li>\u201cDid they forget about my appointment and do I need to call to confirm?\u201d<\/li>\n<li>\u201cDid I actually submit my request?\u201d<\/li>\n<li>\u201cIs this the right company to go with?\u201d<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>So what do customers typically do? They call to confirm that the company got their request.<\/p>\n<p>This weekend, I witnessed this exact thing. Before a scheduled carpet cleaning, the homeowner called to confirm that the appointment is still on. I thought to myself, why is it that people assume service companies will inevitably forget about them? It\u2019s not the same in other industries. I don\u2019t call my airline to make sure my ticket is still valid before my flight, so why should I call a home service company to confirm my appointment after it\u2019s already been scheduled? It\u2019s because we\u2019re nurtured to expect a late technician or worse, a no-show.<\/p>\n<p>This stems from the infrequent communication service providers have with their customers, causing homeowners\u2019 latitude of patience to become exceptionally thin.<\/p>\n<h1><strong>How to fix step 2:<\/strong><\/h1>\n<p>It\u2019s easy. Implement a tool like Dispatch and send automatic status updates to customers through SMS and\/or email. Companies can pop off appointment confirmations, status updates, appointment reminders, on-my-way appointment notifications, feedback surveys, and much more. All of this helps your customers feel informed, aware, and most of all valued.<\/p>\n<h1><strong>Step 3: The moment a customer can\u2019t leave feedback<\/strong><\/h1>\n<p>Before I purchase anything (product or service), I read online reviews. I do it before I buy online, and I do it while I buy in-store. I want to know what others are saying. I want to know what type of experience they had. I want to know if 3-weeks later the person still found value in it. I\u2019m very willing to go to yelp or Google and leave a positive review if I had a good experience. Here\u2019s a review I left after getting my tires changed.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-14221\" src=\"https:\/\/dispatch.me\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/07\/Screen-Shot-2018-07-23-at-3.12.45-PM-1.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"363\" height=\"337\" srcset=\"https:\/\/dispatch.me\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/07\/Screen-Shot-2018-07-23-at-3.12.45-PM-1.png 363w, https:\/\/dispatch.me\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/07\/Screen-Shot-2018-07-23-at-3.12.45-PM-1-300x279.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 363px) 100vw, 363px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>I also left it on Yelp&#8230;<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-14222\" src=\"https:\/\/dispatch.me\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/07\/Screen-Shot-2018-07-23-at-3.16.52-PM-1.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"665\" height=\"240\" srcset=\"https:\/\/dispatch.me\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/07\/Screen-Shot-2018-07-23-at-3.16.52-PM-1.png 665w, https:\/\/dispatch.me\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/07\/Screen-Shot-2018-07-23-at-3.16.52-PM-1-300x108.png 300w, https:\/\/dispatch.me\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/07\/Screen-Shot-2018-07-23-at-3.16.52-PM-1-500x180.png 500w, https:\/\/dispatch.me\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/07\/Screen-Shot-2018-07-23-at-3.16.52-PM-1-380x137.png 380w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 665px) 100vw, 665px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>I wanted to blast it everywhere because I had a great experience and I want to push as many businesses as possible to the companies I enjoy. Most modern customers want their opinion voiced when someone does a good or poor job. It\u2019s just the world we live in! The stigma here is that people only use reviews for negative things\u2026this simply isn\u2019t true. Case in point, look at all the reviews <a href=\"https:\/\/www.google.com\/search?q=mechanic%20somerville&amp;rlz=1C5CHFA_enUS719US720&amp;oq=mechanic+somervi&amp;aqs=chrome.0.0j69i57j0l4.2767j0j1&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;npsic=0&amp;rflfq=1&amp;rlha=0&amp;rllag=42381472,-71086183,960&amp;tbm=lcl&amp;rldimm=9339280595567010056&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjI14mvzrjcAhWtm-AKHbikD-gQvS4IRjAA&amp;rldoc=1&amp;tbs=lrf:!2m1!1e2!2m1!1e3!3sIAE,lf:1,lf_ui:2#lrd=0x89e370ad9f55a52b:0x819bca3854786108,1,,,&amp;rlfi=hd:;si:9339280595567010056;mv:!1m3!1d21884.540463059995!2d-71.10483870000002!3d42.3939613!2m3!1f0!2f0!3f0!3m2!1i684!2i713!4f13.1;tbs:lrf:!2m1!1e2!2m1!1e3!3sIAE,lf:1,lf_ui:2\">Car Zone<\/a> has.<\/p>\n<h1><strong>How to fix step 3:<\/strong><\/h1>\n<p>Most companies don\u2019t like asking for reviews \u2013 which is okay.
