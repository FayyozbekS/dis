That night, she orders a pizza from a popular franchise and watches with anticipation on her phone as the pizza goes from \u201cordered\u201d to \u201cready for delivery.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>The next day, our homeowner goes to heat up the leftover pizza in the oven\u2014and there\u2019s no heat. So she schedules a repair visit with her home warranty company and tracks the technician while playing <i>Ticket to Ride<\/i> on her iPhone.<\/p>\n<p>Thanks to experiences like these, homeowners are setting the bar high for brands they shop with.<\/p>\n<p>When it comes to retaining customers, where does your franchise fall along the customer-pleasing technology-line? If you\u2019re not even on the line, customers may be passing you up for a competitor who offers a better experience.<\/p>\n<h1><strong>Why Mobile Is Key for Franchises<\/strong><\/h1>\n<p>A great mobile experience is no longer a nice-to-have\u2014it\u2019s a necessity. <a href=\"https:\/\/www2.deloitte.com\/us\/en\/pages\/technology-media-and-telecommunications\/articles\/global-mobile-consumer-survey-us-edition.html\">Americans are viewing their smartphones<\/a> an average of 52 times per day, and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.qsrmagazine.com\/outside-insights\/why-mobile-should-be-your-secret-weapon\">65 percent of customers say they\u2019d choose one brand<\/a> over another based on their mobile app alone.<\/p>\n<p>If you haven\u2019t made the leap to a full mobile experience, we understand: For one-off brick and mortar stores, adopting mobile technology is a lot easier than for franchises like yours that have multiple locations.<\/p>\n<p>Here are some franchises that have used their \u201ccustomer-pleasing technology\u201d to improve the customer experience, boost NPS, and reduce customer churn.<\/p>\n<h1><strong>1. Burger King\u2019s App Diverts Customers from Its Rivals<\/strong><\/h1>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-11139 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/dispatch.me\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/01\/BK-App.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"600\" height=\"400\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Burger King boasted <a href=\"https:\/\/www.statista.com\/statistics\/222981\/number-of-burger-king-restaurants-worldwide\/\">close to 18,000 locations in 2018<\/a>, and its app operates not only in the U.S., but also in countries like <a href=\"https:\/\/www.appannie.com\/en\/apps\/ios\/app\/924879230\/\">France<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.appannie.com\/en\/apps\/ios\/app\/burger-kingr-danmark\/\">Denmark<\/a>, and <a href=\"https:\/\/apps.apple.com\/us\/app\/burger-king-mobile-app\/id1095406118\">Mexico<\/span><\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>App users get access to mobile-only coupons and a restaurant locator, and at some locations they can even order with the app and skip the line. Even better, in 2018 Burger King <a href=\"https:\/\/www.adweek.com\/creativity\/after-trolling-mcdonalds-burger-kings-app-was-downloaded-1-million-times-and-hit-no-1\/\">used its app to send customers away from the competition<\/a> right as they were at the rival\u2019s door: The \u201cWhopper Detour\u201d promotion caused the app to unlock a 1-cent Whopper deal when it detected that customers were within 600 feet of a McDonald\u2019s.<\/p>\n<p>The app was downloaded over a million times within just a few days, making it the number-one free app in the Apple App Store. Now, almost a year later, the app <a href=\"https:\/\/apps.apple.com\/us\/app\/burger-king-app\/id638323895\">boasts a 4.7-star rating<\/a> with 47,300 ratings, with comments like \u201cvery convenient\u201d and \u201cthe consistent deals are AMAZING; don\u2019t order BK without this app.\u201d<\/p>\n<h1><strong>2. Domino\u2019s App Lets Customers Track Their Pizzas<\/strong><\/h1>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-11141\" src=\"https:\/\/dispatch.me\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/01\/Dominos-App.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"600\" height=\"400\" \/><\/p>\n<p>This popular pizza chain has close to <a href=\"https:\/\/biz.dominos.com\/web\/public\/about-dominos\/fun-facts\">800 independent franchise owners<\/a> in the U.S., operates stores from the U.S. to Australia to India\u2014and offers customers <a href=\"https:\/\/play.google.com\/store\/apps\/details?id=com.dominospizza&amp;hl=en_US\">an app<\/a> that lets them order Domino\u2019s food from anywhere, and track it from the instant they place the order until it\u2019s ready for pickup or delivery. On the iPhone app, customers can use Dom, the company\u2019s voice ordering assistant, to add items to the cart and select coupons.<\/p>\n<p>Domino\u2019s is constantly changing and adding to the app to keep customers interested. In 2016, for example, the company <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2016\/04\/06\/dominos-now-lets-you-order-pizza-just-by-launching-an-app-no-clicking-required\/\">unveiled a \u201cZero Click\u201d app<\/a> that let customers order simply by opening the app. (Though it did give customers a 10-second countdown just to make sure it wasn\u2019t an accidental order.) And in February 2019, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.popularmechanics.com\/technology\/apps\/a26412440\/dominos-pizza-app-training-ais\/\">Domino\u2019s launched Points for Pies<\/a>, where users could take a picture of any pizza\u2014whether from Domino\u2019s or somewhere else\u2014to earn 10 points. After 60 points, users got a free medium two-topping pizza from Domino&#8217;s.<\/p>\n<h1><strong>3.

Dispatch\u2019s solution increases franchises\u2019 Net Promoter Score by an average of 20%, and reduces time-to-schedule by 40%.
