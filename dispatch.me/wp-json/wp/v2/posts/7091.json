I pressed it again \u2013 the same thing. The small plastic piece that kept the power on was broken.<\/p>\n<p>So I did what every homeowner does when an appliance breaks. I went to the manufacturer\u2019s website, clicked the \u201cdealer locator,\u201d put in my zip code, and found the closest contractor. I called the contractor, waited for a few rings, got their voicemail and left a detailed message.<\/p>\n<p>The next day I waited for a callback.<\/p>\n<p>5 pm came around and still nothing. I called the company back and the voicemail said they closed at 4 pm. Great\u2026<\/p>\n<p>3 days pass by and I finally get someone on the line.<\/p>\n<p><center><br \/>\n\u201cHow can I help you?\u201d The office assistant said.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m trying to schedule an appointment, and it\u2019s somewhat hard to get a hold of you guys,\u201d I told them.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWhat do you need done?\u201d (she apparently didn\u2019t listen to my 2 previous voicemails)<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThe power button on my dishwasher needs fixing.

Can I send you a photo of it?\u201d<\/p>\n<p>\u201cSend it to my cell phone. Here\u2019s my number\u2026.\u201d (We\u2019re now playing telephone-tag because she will send it to the contractor who will then tell her what to tell me.)<\/p>\n<p>\u201cOkay. Did you get it?\u201d<\/p>\n<p>\u201cYup, got the photo. I\u2019ll schedule you for next Thursday from 2pm-5pm. That\u2019s the earliest opening. Does that work?\u201d<\/p>\n<p>\u201cSure, I\u2019ll have to take time off work but I can be home.

I called them at 4:45 pm to ask where the contractor was. I was reminded that they closed their office at 4 pm so there was no way of knowing if the technician is running late or just not coming.<\/p>\n<p>That day went by and I didn\u2019t hear anything from the company.<\/p>\n<p>So right now I bet you\u2019re wondering why I haven\u2019t switched companies? Well, they were the only company in Boston that could fix my off-brand dishwasher. Since it was so hard to schedule them, I seriously contemplated buying a new dishwasher because I had no clear solution for fixing it.<\/p>\n<p>Three weeks went by and all of a sudden my phone rings. It\u2019s the dispatcher.<\/p>\n<p><center><br \/>\n\u201cI\u2019m so sorry. I went on vacation for three weeks to Europe.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>\u201cOkay? I didn\u2019t hear anything from you guys, so I almost bought a new one.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>\u201cNo, don\u2019t buy a new one. The next available time we can get a technician out there is at the end of next week. Want me to schedule it?\u201d<\/p>\n<p>\u201cYou mean 12 day\u2019s from now?\u201d<\/p>\n<p>\u201cYeah.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>\u201cOkay. If that\u2019s the earliest time then let\u2019s schedule it.\u201d I said.<br \/>\n<\/center><\/p>\n<p>12 days go by and they call saying that they can\u2019t come that day because they ordered the wrong part. They\u2019re going to have to wait for another 12-days&#8230;<\/p>\n<p>(I really can\u2019t make this up. In this past year, I\u2019ve started balding and I\u2019m pretty sure this experience had something to do with it.)<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/dispatch.me\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/05\/Waiting-for-Service-1.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"648\" height=\"333\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-14241\" srcset=\"https:\/\/dispatch.me\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/05\/Waiting-for-Service-1.png 648w, https:\/\/dispatch.me\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/05\/Waiting-for-Service-1-300x154.png 300w, https:\/\/dispatch.me\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/05\/Waiting-for-Service-1-500x257.png 500w, https:\/\/dispatch.me\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/05\/Waiting-for-Service-1-380x195.png 380w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 648px) 100vw, 648px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Another week goes by.<\/p>\n<p>I called on the morning of the appointment to confirm that they were coming. They verbally confirmed that the technician would arrive between 2 pm \u2013 5 pm.<\/p>\n<p>5 pm hits. Still nothing.<\/p>\n<p>Finally, the next day they arrive! The technician walked in, didn\u2019t say anything about taking months to fix my dishwasher, and then proceeded to ask me if I had a specific Allen Wrench. The technician was asking to borrow my tools. He was lucky that I had the right one he was looking for. He proceeded to spend 15-minutes working on my dishwasher then slapped a bill for $275 on my table. I paid him, and he left in a hurry.<\/p>\n<h1><strong>How technology can improve every aspect of this service experience:<\/strong><\/h1>\n<h3>The Scheduling Dance<\/h3>\n<p>Playing phone tag is old hat. The service companies that adopt new technologies to create modern consumer experiences will retain customers longer, improve NPS faster, and reduce overhead. Similar to how Google\u2019s new AI assistant can schedule an appointment for users, tools like Dispatch can dramatically streamline scheduling for both customers and businesses.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/dispatch.me\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/05\/Select-Three-Times-1.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"648\" height=\"352\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-14242\" srcset=\"https:\/\/dispatch.me\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/05\/Select-Three-Times-1.png 648w, https:\/\/dispatch.me\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/05\/Select-Three-Times-1-300x163.png 300w, https:\/\/dispatch.me\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/05\/Select-Three-Times-1-500x272.png 500w, https:\/\/dispatch.me\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/05\/Select-Three-Times-1-380x206.png 380w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 648px) 100vw, 648px\" \/><\/p>\n<h1><strong>How Dispatch solves the scheduling dance<\/strong><\/h1>\n<p>The Dispatch experience looks like this:<\/p>\n<ol style=\"margin:0;padding:0;\">\n<li>The customer visits the manufacturer\u2019s website.<\/li>\n<li>The customer clicks \u201cFind a Dealer\u201d<\/li>\n<li>The customer puts in their zip code and finds the best available technician to fix their issue<\/li>\n<li>The customer click \u201cbook now.\u201d<\/li>\n<li>The customer selects the three best available times that work well for their schedule<\/li>\n<li>The customer get\u2019s text message saying that one of their three times has been scheduled.

I either had to call the main office or wait for the technician to arrive to know what was going on. Customers like me are constantly left in the dark, feeling hopeless as they wait for the technician to arrive.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/dispatch.me\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/05\/Broken-Dishwasher-1.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"648\" height=\"333\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-14243\" srcset=\"https:\/\/dispatch.me\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/05\/Broken-Dishwasher-1.png 648w, https:\/\/dispatch.me\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/05\/Broken-Dishwasher-1-300x154.png 300w, https:\/\/dispatch.me\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/05\/Broken-Dishwasher-1-500x257.png 500w, https:\/\/dispatch.me\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/05\/Broken-Dishwasher-1-380x195.png 380w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 648px) 100vw, 648px\" \/><\/p>\n<h1><strong>How Dispatch solves customer communication issues<\/strong><\/h1>\n<p>With advanced customer experience platforms, technicians can communicate with homeowners, dispatchers can send automatic appointment reminders, and homeowners can send notes and photos about a job directly to both. So for example, I could have sent my dishwasher photo directly to both the dispatcher and technician so that everyone will be on the same page. The moment communication in the field service space isn\u2019t connected, chaos festers.<\/p>\n<h3>The Day of Service Experience<\/h3>\n<p>Homeowners are accustomed to long service windows. They bat an eye at the ole\u2019 \u201c2pm-5pm\u201d service window but they tolerate it because it\u2019s expected. Since this window is long, homeowners typically take time off of work and patiently wait for the truck to pull in the driveway.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/dispatch.me\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/05\/On-my-way-1.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"648\" height=\"333\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-14244\" srcset=\"https:\/\/dispatch.me\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/05\/On-my-way-1.png 648w, https:\/\/dispatch.me\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/05\/On-my-way-1-300x154.png 300w, https:\/\/dispatch.me\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/05\/On-my-way-1-500x257.png 500w, https:\/\/dispatch.me\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/05\/On-my-way-1-380x195.png 380w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 648px) 100vw, 648px\" \/><\/p>\n<h1><strong>How Dispatch solves the day of service experience<\/strong><\/h1>\n<p>The On-My-Way notification reduces customer no-shows by 86%. When a customer gets this alert, they can leave work with enough time to meet the technician at the front door. You won\u2019t have long service windows because when the on-my-way notification says that the technician will arrive in 30-minutes, the homeowner can leave work with enough time to spare.<\/p>\n<h3>The moment after service<\/h3>\n<p>I had no way of leaving feedback for the technician that fixed my dishwasher. I could call the company back and hope they listened to my feedback, let alone answered the phone, but that wasn\u2019t convenient to me. Instead, the easier outlet I had was to leave a review on their Google page \u2013 a more public forum.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/dispatch.me\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/05\/Customer-Feedback-1.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"648\" height=\"333\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-14245\" srcset=\"https:\/\/dispatch.me\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/05\/Customer-Feedback-1.png 648w, https:\/\/dispatch.me\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/05\/Customer-Feedback-1-300x154.png 300w, https:\/\/dispatch.me\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/05\/Customer-Feedback-1-500x257.png 500w, https:\/\/dispatch.me\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/05\/Customer-Feedback-1-380x195.png 380w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 648px) 100vw, 648px\" \/><\/p>\n<h1><strong>How Dispatch solves the moment after service<\/strong><\/h1>\n<p>Immediately after a job is complete, a survey notification gets sent to the homeowner. With a few swipes and taps, they can rate and review their technician. The best part is if the review is negative, the company is alerted and they can call the homeowner to remedy any negative situation before they decide to voice their opinion on Google.<\/p>\n<p>To learn how you can quickly implement a customer experience tool like Dispatch, request a demo and we\u2019ll gladly help.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>There are universal truths to life: No matter how much we curse in traffic jams, they won\u2019t get any faster.
