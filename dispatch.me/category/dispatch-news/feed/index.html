										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h4>Introducing Dispatch Academy!</h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Promoting the adoption of Dispatch across your network is one of the most important things you can do to get the most value out of our platform.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Courtesy of their partnership with your brand, providers in your network have access to a wide variety of features in Dispatch, and to a great new training resource called <a href="https://academy.dispatch.me/videos">Dispatch Academy</a>. Dispatch Academy is a dedicated help and training center for providers in your network, which includes a variety of blissfully brief tutorial videos </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">(most are under 3 minutes)</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-large wp-image-15017" src="https://dispatch.me/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Academy-1024x641.png" alt="" width="1024" height="641" srcset="https://dispatch.me/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Academy-1024x641.png 1024w, https://dispatch.me/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Academy-300x188.png 300w, https://dispatch.me/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Academy-768x481.png 768w, https://dispatch.me/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Academy-1536x961.png 1536w, https://dispatch.me/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Academy-2048x1282.png 2048w, https://dispatch.me/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Academy-1444x904.png 1444w, https://dispatch.me/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Academy-500x313.png 500w, https://dispatch.me/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Academy-591x370.png 591w, https://dispatch.me/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Academy-380x238.png 380w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dispatch Academy covers a wide variety of training topics for your providers including:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Getting the most out of our mobile apps</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Creating estimates and billing documents</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Communicating with you and your customers</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pulling reporting and analytics</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ensuring a great experience for your customers</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We think it’s important for your providers to have access to quick demos of all of the tools they have at their disposal and the ability to see these features in action, and the new Dispatch Academy is a great way to provide ongoing support and education for them.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dispatch Academy is accessible to anyone by visiting </span><a href="https://academy.dispatch.me/videos"><span style="font-weight: 400;">academy.dispatch.me</span></a> <span style="font-weight: 400;">in your web browser.</span></p>

<p>By using Dispatch, Flo was able to <strong>engage their contractors</strong>, <strong>optimize their service operations</strong>, open up <strong>transparent messaging across all parties</strong> in the service experience, and provide <strong>loyalty-inspiring experiences</strong> to their customers.</p>
<p><em>&#8220;We needed to be able to <strong>connect the homeowner to the contractor and to have visibility into the job</strong>. We needed to be able to communicate with the contractor and see their activity, and then to follow up with them and find out about what happened with each job.</em></p>
<p>We found Dispatch and it’s allowed us to bring a great experience to our customers and our installers. It’s allowed us to build a great relationship with them, and to get feedback from our customers that our installers are doing what they should be doing &#8211; <strong>giving great service</strong>.&#8221;</p>
<p>With Dispatch, Flo by Moen was able to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Reduce service call volume</li>
<li>Reduce time spent on operational task</li>
<li>Reduce job cycle time</li>
<li>Increase customer NPS and CSAT</li>
</ul>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You may already use our enterprise Manage platform for understanding the metrics around your jobs and your pro performance, but chances are there are a few features that you may not know about. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In this issue of the Dispatch Digest, we will highlight a few lesser-known but majorly powerful features inside Manage, and show you how to access our great training materials to make sure you are getting the most out of Dispatch.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Let’s get started!</span></p>
<h3><b>Account User Filters</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There is an abundance of valuable service intelligence data in Manage &#8211; so much that it may be overwhelming, especially if you have users who need different levels of visibility into the data. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We recently launched a way to allow different levels of access to different users within each company that uses our software. Account User Filters allow you to display or suppress certain data depending on the user.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This flexibility opens up endless possibilities around who can benefit from Manage, even if you don’t want everyone to have complete visibility into all of your data. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This even allows you to enable users outside your organization to see certain things. This is great for distributors, dealers, or service providers who work closely with your organization and could benefit from some of the great reports you have access to.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Account User Filters are available to all Manage users. Work with your Dispatch account manager to enable them today!</span></p>
<h3><b>Technician Reporting</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When you look at your service providers in Manage, you can see valuable data such as SLA compliance and average customer reviews. Our reporting gets even more granular, though, allowing you to see metrics about the people in the field actually doing your jobs. We call this Technician Reporting &#8211; though it isn’t limited to just field service technicians.</span></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-14981" src="https://dispatch.me/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Technician-Reporting.png" alt="" width="1681" height="458" srcset="https://dispatch.me/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Technician-Reporting.png 1681w, https://dispatch.me/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Technician-Reporting-300x82.png 300w, https://dispatch.me/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Technician-Reporting-1024x279.png 1024w, https://dispatch.me/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Technician-Reporting-768x209.png 768w, https://dispatch.me/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Technician-Reporting-1536x418.png 1536w, https://dispatch.me/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Technician-Reporting-1444x393.png 1444w, https://dispatch.me/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Technician-Reporting-500x136.png 500w, https://dispatch.me/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Technician-Reporting-840x229.png 840w, https://dispatch.me/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Technician-Reporting-380x104.png 380w" sizes="(max-width: 1681px) 100vw, 1681px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Service providers sometimes have difficulty determining performance at a technician-level. With Dispatch, we monitor metrics such as: </span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">First time fix rate</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Technician rating</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Average time to complete</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gaining access to these metrics can help you work with your pros to identify the best technicians, and help lower-performance technicians improve their performance.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Combined with Account User Filters, you can share versions of Manage with distributors or key service providers, giving them direct access to this valuable data.</span></p>
<h3><b>Manage Training and Support</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Don’t forget, the Manage help center is always available for you inside our platform. It can answer frequently asked questions and help you discover even more great Manage features.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Check out the short videos for each Manage dashboard, available now in the help center!</span></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-14982" src="https://dispatch.me/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Help-Center.png" alt="" width="417" height="618" style="border: 1px solid #D0CFCD; srcset="https://dispatch.me/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Help-Center.png 417w, https://dispatch.me/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Help-Center-202x300.png 202w, https://dispatch.me/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Help-Center-250x370.png 250w, https://dispatch.me/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Help-Center-380x563.png 380w" sizes="(max-width: 417px) 100vw, 417px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Help Center is available to all Manage users, and can be found quickly by clicking “Help Center” in the bottom left corner of every Manage screen.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3><span style="color: #0fc13a;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dispatch </span><b>Lead Conversion Reporting</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> helps you and your distributors close more leads</span></span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The world of sales is data-driven. The modern sales rep has access to data that helps them sell more efficiently than ever, but without attribution and conversion data, you’ll only get so far.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As a manufacturer, you are driving leads to your dealers &#8211; and your distributors are just as invested in helping convert them as you are. This ecosystem is the critical backbone of your sales channels, but when the time comes to understand lead conversion rate or the effectiveness of your marketing spend, working with independent distributors and dealers can be a challenge.</span></p>
<p><em><a href="https://dispatch.me/demo-form-blog/">Want to see Dispatch in action? Request a demo here.</a></em></p>
<h4><b>What happened to this lead?</b></h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We hear this question constantly. Each lead that comes in through your website represents not only potential revenue, but also valuable and </span><b>actionable data about the effectiveness of your marketing spend, the performance of your dealers/distributors, and the satisfaction of your end customers.</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, the separation between all of these parties means it can be difficult or impossible to actually understand what happened to each lead you send out. Was it accepted? Did a sale occur? Did the dealer perform up to your standards? Did you build loyalty with your customers?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Dispatch Platform answers these questions. Manufacturers who have implemented Dispatch and worked with us to engage their dealers are able to see what is happening to every lead coming through their website &#8211; as a matter of fact, our customers have found that <strong>dealers who use Dispatch are 50% more likely to status leads</strong> than dealers outside of the Dispatch ecosystem.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Further building on this use case, we have just rolled out the Dispatch Lead Conversion Report, which gives you dealer-level and lead-level visibility into:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lead conversion rate</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lead status and final outcome</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dealer geographical coverage</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Close rate by dealer</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lead win/loss reason</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dealer decline/cancel reason</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tracking this lead data over time can </span><b>help you and your distributors make more informed decisions about the performance of each dealer</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, allowing you to cultivate the perfect network of dealers that represent your brand, leading to higher lead conversion rates and more revenue.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This, of course, is only made possible by using Dispatch, which connects you with your distributors, dealers, and end customers on one unifying platform.</span></p>
<h4><b>Empower your Distributors</b></h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Making this data available to your distributors will allow them to identify high performing dealers who effectively convert leads in a quick and transparent manner, and help them work with lower-performing dealers to improve their ability to sell and close.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This powerful new lead reporting is part of our Explore reporting suite inside our Manage platform, available to manufacturers who want to close more leads and gain visibility into their business.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Understanding the performance of your independent service providers, dealers, or franchise locations is one of the most critical and challenging parts of running your service business.</strong> </span>Working with Dispatch gives you access to job and provider data that can help you tailor your network and ultimately improve customer satisfaction through better service experiences delivered by your highest-performing pros.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We are very excited to show off new functionality in our Manage enterprise platform &#8211; Service Provider Profiles &#8211; that will show you detailed performance metrics and trends for your pros, and enable you to make informed decisions about your service operations.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">All of this data is available to both you and your pros, so you can reference Dispatch data when discussing performance with your pros in real time.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h1 style="text-align: left;"><span style="color: #0fc132;"><b>Vista Equity Partners, Dispatch Investor</b></span></h1>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/Vista_Equity">Vista Equity Partners</a> (Vista) became an investor in Dispatch in September 2018 after being introduced to the company by another Dispatch investor, GrandBanks Capital. <a href="https://www.facebook.com/VistaEquityPartners/">Vista is a leading global investment firm</a> that is exclusively focused on enterprise software, data and technology-enabled businesses. This investment was made out of Vista’s Endeavor Fund, which works with emerging enterprise software companies that are poised for high-growth and offer mission-critical data and software solutions. The Vista Endeavor Fund helps emerging companies expand their product development and make a larger impact in the market they serve by allowing for sustainable growth.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/profile/company/389272Z:US">Vista’s investment</a> in Dispatch has helped enable the firm to further the reach of their existing home services and logistics services technologies. In 2019, Dispatch was ranked on the Inc. 5000 list in the <a href="https://dispatch.me/dispatch-ranked-in-top-10-of-fastest-growing-companies-in-america/">top 10% of the fastest-growing companies</a> in America. René Yang Stewart, Senior Managing Director and Co-Head of the Vista Endeavor Fund said of the investment, “We are thrilled to partner with the Dispatch team to help accelerate growth and continue to enhance the value they bring to home service providers. Dispatch has established a unique position in their ability to connect homeowners, enterprise brands, and service providers which creates a strong platform that we’re excited to help grow and innovate with the Dispatch team.”</p>
<p>Dispatch Chief Strategy Officer, Avi Goldberg, was enthusiastic about <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/vista-equity-partners">Vista backing</a> the Boston-based technology company. He said, “Home service companies have long struggled to meet customer expectations. Companies like Uber and Amazon have raised the bar even further for how a business should interact with its customers. We started Dispatch to bring the same consumer-first technology to the home service market. We do so by seamlessly connecting brands, service providers, and homeowners together, creating a modern, interactive customer experience. This results in two things: happy homeowners and brands with deep insights into their service delivery networks. We’re excited to continue this mission, and specifically chose to partner with Vista because of their strong track record for growing successful SaaS companies around the world.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Delivering excellent service is complex. Customer expectations are higher than ever, and working with independent pros can be challenging. Being able to openly communicate across every party in the service experience can help save operational time and cost, and goes a long way towards giving an excellent service experience for your customers. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Through the Dispatch platform, you can stay in touch with your pros, and they can easily communicate with your customers throughout the job. Take a look at the great messaging features you can get with Dispatch:</span></p>
<h3><b>Enterprise Messaging</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You may already be using our Manage enterprise app and Explore reporting to help manage your pros and understand the quality of the service they are delivering to your customers. We’ve recently added the ability to message your pros from directly inside the Manage platform.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For each job you’ve assigned to a pro, you can send and receive messages throughout the job lifecycle, giving you the ability to check-in, remediate customer complaints, and just understand the status of your jobs in a more holistic way.</span></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class=" wp-image-14721 aligncenter" src="https://dispatch.me/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Screenshot-1-ent-messaging-300x145.png" alt="" width="670" height="324" srcset="https://dispatch.me/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Screenshot-1-ent-messaging-300x145.png 300w, https://dispatch.me/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Screenshot-1-ent-messaging-768x372.png 768w, https://dispatch.me/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Screenshot-1-ent-messaging-500x242.png 500w, https://dispatch.me/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Screenshot-1-ent-messaging-764x370.png 764w, https://dispatch.me/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Screenshot-1-ent-messaging-380x184.png 380w, https://dispatch.me/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Screenshot-1-ent-messaging.png 979w" sizes="(max-width: 670px) 100vw, 670px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Messaging can be accessed at the job-level. Now, when viewing individual job details, you’ll automatically see the messaging window on the left-hand side of the screen.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When you send messages to your pros, they get in-app and email notifications, and can use their Dispatch Work desktop app to see your messages and respond. All of the messaging around a single job will be included in the job details page throughout the job lifecycle, creating trackable communication between you and your pros.</span></p>
<h3><b>Service Pro Messaging</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the most powerful things about using Dispatch is giving your pros access to world-class field service management tools, helping them deliver excellent experiences for your customers in a transparent and trackable way. Just like our enterprise-facing app, our field service tools enable your pros to communicate effectively with you and your customers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Our Communicate module has always allowed your pros to message with your customers throughout the job lifecycle. Pros can send messages through Dispatch, and customers can reply via email or SMS &#8211; whichever method they prefer. This makes it easy to stay in touch, which can reduce job scheduling and cycle time, and vastly improve the customer experience. Message history is saved at the customer-level, creating a valuable communication log that can further improve your relationship with your customers.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now, we’ve beefed up our Communicate module to include inter-office messaging, streamlining communication between office and field staff so that they can easily communicate with one another within Dispatch. This kind of messaging keeps everyone up-to-date on what’s going on with a job, and encourages the usage of Dispatch for all your pros.</span></p>
<h3><b>Customer Messaging</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Delivering excellent customer experiences is at the core of what Dispatch does, and enabling them to easily communicate with your pros throughout the job is one of the key ways we do that.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As mentioned, it’s easy for your pros to send your customers omni-channel messages during a job, and it’s even easier for them to reply in whatever way is easiest for them.</span></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="wp-image-14723 alignright" src="https://dispatch.me/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/screenshot-3-customer-173x300.png" alt="" width="187" height="325" srcset="https://dispatch.me/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/screenshot-3-customer-173x300.png 173w, https://dispatch.me/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/screenshot-3-customer-213x370.png 213w, https://dispatch.me/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/screenshot-3-customer.png 313w" sizes="(max-width: 187px) 100vw, 187px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As a matter of fact, </span><b>when using our Communicate functionality, we’ve seen star ratings improve by over ¼ star per job</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Being able to ask your pro questions, and answer simple requests ahead of time, makes delivering quick and efficient service easier than ever before.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">All of these messaging features are available through Dispatch, and go a long way to reducing the time it takes to deliver greatly-improved customer service when a job needs to get done.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reach out to your Dispatch account manager to learn more about these great messaging features.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Welcome to the Dispatch Digest! Take a look at some of the great new features we are highlighting this month:</p>
<p><b>Appointment Types</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some jobs are complex, and require different types of experts to visit a home over the course of several appointments. During these jobs, it’s important to stay organized and make sure everyone knows what they need to do for each appointment.<strong><img loading="lazy" class="wp-image-14647 alignright" style="padding: 1px; border: thin solid gray;" src="https://dispatch.me/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Appointment-Types-473x1024.png" alt="" width="244" height="528" srcset="https://dispatch.me/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Appointment-Types-473x1024.png 473w, https://dispatch.me/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Appointment-Types-139x300.png 139w, https://dispatch.me/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Appointment-Types-768x1663.png 768w, https://dispatch.me/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Appointment-Types-709x1536.png 709w, https://dispatch.me/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Appointment-Types-946x2048.png 946w, https://dispatch.me/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Appointment-Types-376x815.png 376w, https://dispatch.me/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Appointment-Types-171x370.png 171w, https://dispatch.me/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Appointment-Types-380x823.png 380w, https://dispatch.me/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Appointment-Types.png 1125w" sizes="(max-width: 244px) 100vw, 244px" /></strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To address this, Dispatch has added </span><b>Appointment Types</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> into our field service toolset. This new feature will allow you to designate each appointment with a specific type, helping you quickly identify important appointment details, such as who needs to be there, what inventory or parts they will need, and how long the appointment will likely take.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For project-based work or complex jobs, you can assign multiple appointments of different types (such as “service” vs. “install”) to an individual job in the Dispatch system. When your dispatcher is in the office looking at our schedule page, they will quickly be able to see which appointments have a corresponding type, and can schedule or make assignments at a glance based on that information.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Appointment Types can be unique to your own business, and can be set as templates to use when your providers schedule jobs with your customers. This is a great way for your providers to stay more organized and complete jobs as efficiently as possible.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This useful new feature can be enabled by your account manager, so please reach out directly for more information and to get started.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Scheduling with Suggested Times</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img loading="lazy" class=" wp-image-14649 alignleft" style="padding: 1px; border: thin solid gray;" src="https://dispatch.me/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Suggested-Times.png" alt="" width="313" height="307" srcset="https://dispatch.me/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Suggested-Times.png 531w, https://dispatch.me/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Suggested-Times-300x294.png 300w, https://dispatch.me/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Suggested-Times-500x491.png 500w, https://dispatch.me/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Suggested-Times-377x370.png 377w, https://dispatch.me/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Suggested-Times-380x373.png 380w" sizes="(max-width: 313px) 100vw, 313px" />One of our most popular features at Dispatch is </span><b>Scheduling with Suggested Times</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. We know that working with an independent network of service providers, or across decentralized franchise locations, can present challenges when scheduling jobs with your customers. You don’t always have access to real-time availability, but you still want to give your customers a quick, easy, and accurate scheduling experience.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Enter suggested times &#8211; a great way to speed up the scheduling process, even without direct access to your providers’ schedules. Suggested Times allows you to collect one to three ideal appointment times from your customers when they are requesting service, and communicate those times to your provider to speed up scheduling.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These times can be collected at several points in the booking and scheduling process, and can be adapted to fit your specific workflow. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We have found that providers</span><b> accept one of the ideal time slots on 80% of jobs</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which we’ve seen significantly </span><b>reduce time to schedule by up to 40%</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To see if Scheduling with Suggested Times can help your booking and scheduling flow, reach out to your account manager.</span></p>
<h2></h2>
<p><b>Engagement Services &#8211; In-App Callouts</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What good is a feature if your providers are not using it? We understand that getting the most out of Dispatch relies on engaging as many of the service providers in your network as possible. Our dedicated Engagement team works side by side with you to achieve this, and has many tools at their disposal to help drive adoption and engagement, regardless of how your providers prefer to work with you.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of our most powerful engagement tools is our </span><b>in-app callout</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> functionality. With this service, we can actually put reminders and other messages directly into our Work (desktop) field service toolset, so your providers attention can be drawn to the features and best practices that will help you get the most value out of the Dispatch ecosystem.</span></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="wp-image-14648 aligncenter" style="padding: 1px; border: thin solid gray;" src="https://dispatch.me/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Callouts-1024x507.png" alt="" width="901" height="446" srcset="https://dispatch.me/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Callouts-1024x507.png 1024w, https://dispatch.me/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Callouts-300x149.png 300w, https://dispatch.me/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Callouts-768x381.png 768w, https://dispatch.me/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Callouts-1536x761.png 1536w, https://dispatch.me/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Callouts-2048x1015.png 2048w, https://dispatch.me/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Callouts-1444x716.png 1444w, https://dispatch.me/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Callouts-500x248.png 500w, https://dispatch.me/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Callouts-747x370.png 747w, https://dispatch.me/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Callouts-380x188.png 380w" sizes="(max-width: 901px) 100vw, 901px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is a great way to remind providers to collect photos from a job, or to attach specific notes to jobs when appropriate. You could also use it to remind your providers to view the customer’s suggested appointment times before they reach out to schedule. Callouts can even be combined to create walkthroughs that help providers stick to your specific workflow, and collect all the right information. Wherever you see the opportunity to give a reminder, we can help you get the most out of the tools we offer with our custom callouts.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Callouts are available to all customers &#8211; we will work with you to figure out how to get the most out of this feature. Please reach out to your account manager, or </span><a href="mailto:engagement@dispatch.me"><span style="font-weight: 400;">engagement@dispatch.me</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to get started.</span></p>
