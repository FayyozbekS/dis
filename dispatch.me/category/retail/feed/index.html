]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The other day I noticed a wet spot in my closet. My fiance and I live in a tiny apartment (or glorified shoebox depending on how you see it) in the North End of Boston. Over the past 4-years, we have had our fair share of issues with the apartment. When something like this happens I call my landlord (who lives overseas) and tell him what needs to be fixed. He always responds with, “Okay, just schedule a fix, pay for it, and take it off of rent.”</p>
<p>So I type “home service repair” into Google and find the highest-rated service company. After I call them and leave a message, I get a call back to schedule my appointment. At that moment, I realized that most service providers unknowingly neglect the most important thing about “home service” – the experience.</p>
<p>So, to all service providers, OEMs, or any company that offers in-home service, please listen to this plea…</p>
<p>My blood doesn’t boil because my pipes are leaking, my blood boils because of the moments between where I’m left in the dark with little to no communication from the service companies. These moments are the “experiences” that every home service company neglects – the hopeless minutes homeowners feel when waiting for the technician to arrive.</p>
<p>Modern companies have noticed that we live in a customer-centric world and customers now expect to be kept in the loop about everything! They want to know:</p>
<ul style="margin: 0; padding: 0;">
<li>Who is arriving?</li>
<li>When will they be arriving?</li>
<li>What do they look like?</li>
<li>Can I leave feedback?</li>
<li>Can I communicate with them ahead of time?</li>
<li>Can I easily reschedule or cancel the appointment?</li>
<li>Can I do everything on my phone?</li>
</ul>
<p>With consumer expectations rising, it’s time to demand more of your brand and deliver a modern customer experience.</p>
<p>In this post, we break down how to turn those hopeless moments into tech-driven memorable experiences.</p>
<h1><strong>Step 1: The moment a customer needs help</strong></h1>
<p>Ask yourself this, how frustrating is it when companies make it difficult to schedule an appointment? You search for the “book now” button only to realize that they don’t have one. So you dial the dispatcher, wait for someone to call back, and schedule a time that most likely isn’t built around your schedule but theirs. Nothing about this sounds like an optimal customer experience does it?</p>
<p>The importance of customer experience in the age of instant gratification is now higher than ever.</p>
<h1><strong>How to fix step 1:</strong></h1>
<p>Simple. Build in a process that allows homeowners to schedule appointments with your company at a time and date that works best for them. Here’s what you do – add a “Book Now” button that takes homeowners to a form where they can share details about their need, fill out their contact information, select the best days and times that work well for them, and easily send their service request with a click of a button.</p>
<p>Then, and this is the most important part, the company sends the homeowner a text message confirming that they received the service request. This immediate communication lets the homeowner know that you have their best intentions in mind and you’re on it. It adds a little bode of confidence in their mind that your brand has everything under control.</p>
<h1><strong>Step 2: The moment the customer starts to feel left in the dark</strong></h1>
<p>How annoying is it when you text someone a question and they don’t get back for a few days? You start thinking – Are they mad at me? Was I too pushy? Why aren’t they responding? The silence messes with your rationality and just like any other human being you craft a narrative that explains/justifies their silence – often based on zero evidence.</p>
<p>The same goes for service companies. When I schedule an appointment and don’t hear anything from the company for a while, I begin thinking:</p>
<ul style="margin: 0; padding: 0;">
<li>“Did they forget about my appointment and do I need to call to confirm?”</li>
<li>“Did I actually submit my request?”</li>
<li>“Is this the right company to go with?”</li>
</ul>
<p>So what do customers typically do? They call to confirm that the company got their request.</p>
<p>This weekend, I witnessed this exact thing. Before a scheduled carpet cleaning, the homeowner called to confirm that the appointment is still on. I thought to myself, why is it that people assume service companies will inevitably forget about them? It’s not the same in other industries. I don’t call my airline to make sure my ticket is still valid before my flight, so why should I call a home service company to confirm my appointment after it’s already been scheduled? It’s because we’re nurtured to expect a late technician or worse, a no-show.</p>
<p>This stems from the infrequent communication service providers have with their customers, causing homeowners’ latitude of patience to become exceptionally thin.</p>
<h1><strong>How to fix step 2:</strong></h1>
<p>It’s easy. Implement a tool like Dispatch and send automatic status updates to customers through SMS and/or email. Companies can pop off appointment confirmations, status updates, appointment reminders, on-my-way appointment notifications, feedback surveys, and much more. All of this helps your customers feel informed, aware, and most of all valued.</p>
<h1><strong>Step 3: The moment a customer can’t leave feedback</strong></h1>
<p>Before I purchase anything (product or service), I read online reviews. I do it before I buy online, and I do it while I buy in-store. I want to know what others are saying. I want to know what type of experience they had. I want to know if 3-weeks later the person still found value in it. I’m very willing to go to yelp or Google and leave a positive review if I had a good experience. Here’s a review I left after getting my tires changed.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-14221" src="https://dispatch.me/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Screen-Shot-2018-07-23-at-3.12.45-PM-1.png" alt="" width="363" height="337" srcset="https://dispatch.me/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Screen-Shot-2018-07-23-at-3.12.45-PM-1.png 363w, https://dispatch.me/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Screen-Shot-2018-07-23-at-3.12.45-PM-1-300x279.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 363px) 100vw, 363px" /></p>
<p>I also left it on Yelp&#8230;</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-14222" src="https://dispatch.me/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Screen-Shot-2018-07-23-at-3.16.52-PM-1.png" alt="" width="665" height="240" srcset="https://dispatch.me/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Screen-Shot-2018-07-23-at-3.16.52-PM-1.png 665w, https://dispatch.me/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Screen-Shot-2018-07-23-at-3.16.52-PM-1-300x108.png 300w, https://dispatch.me/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Screen-Shot-2018-07-23-at-3.16.52-PM-1-500x180.png 500w, https://dispatch.me/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Screen-Shot-2018-07-23-at-3.16.52-PM-1-380x137.png 380w" sizes="(max-width: 665px) 100vw, 665px" /></p>
<p>I wanted to blast it everywhere because I had a great experience and I want to push as many businesses as possible to the companies I enjoy. Most modern customers want their opinion voiced when someone does a good or poor job. It’s just the world we live in! The stigma here is that people only use reviews for negative things…this simply isn’t true. Case in point, look at all the reviews <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=mechanic%20somerville&amp;rlz=1C5CHFA_enUS719US720&amp;oq=mechanic+somervi&amp;aqs=chrome.0.0j69i57j0l4.2767j0j1&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;npsic=0&amp;rflfq=1&amp;rlha=0&amp;rllag=42381472,-71086183,960&amp;tbm=lcl&amp;rldimm=9339280595567010056&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjI14mvzrjcAhWtm-AKHbikD-gQvS4IRjAA&amp;rldoc=1&amp;tbs=lrf:!2m1!1e2!2m1!1e3!3sIAE,lf:1,lf_ui:2#lrd=0x89e370ad9f55a52b:0x819bca3854786108,1,,,&amp;rlfi=hd:;si:9339280595567010056;mv:!1m3!1d21884.540463059995!2d-71.10483870000002!3d42.3939613!2m3!1f0!2f0!3f0!3m2!1i684!2i713!4f13.1;tbs:lrf:!2m1!1e2!2m1!1e3!3sIAE,lf:1,lf_ui:2">Car Zone</a> has.</p>
<h1><strong>How to fix step 3:</strong></h1>
<p>Most companies don’t like asking for reviews – which is okay. Dispatch removes that awkward moment with a survey link that is authentically sent the moment a job is complete. So now you can collect every possible review and begin to solidify yourself as an excellent company to do business with.</p>
<p>As a customer, if I’m presented with a quick survey on my phone, I’m much more likely to fill it out – versus getting a link and having to type it in online.</p>
<p>Because of Dispatch’s feedback flow, they’ve helped companies increase their survey feedback response rate by 220%.</p>
<p>So if you’re a company and you’re looking to improve your last-mile customer experience then check us out. Everything presented here is why we exist as an organization. We strive to help home service companies deliver memorable customer experiences.</p>

<p>Choosing the right field service management (FSM) tool is a significant investment in time and resources. Bringing on new solutions is always a challenge as your third- party network has no obligation or incentive to use them, meaning the ROI of your new tool could diminish.</p>
<p>If you’re one of the many home services brands that outsource to a network of third-party service providers, the standard FSM tools won’t be as effective. These solutions are built for dedicated service providers; your third-party network has no obligation or incentive to use them, meaning your investment could be wasted.</p>
<p>Download our white paper at the bottom of this page to learn more about what happens when your service provider network doesn’t adopt your field service management software and how to get them to use it.</p>
<p>For now, enjoy this sample of the white paper.</p>

<h2>What Happens When Your Service Provider Network Doesn’t Adopt Your <strong>Field Service Management Software</strong></h2>
<div class="page" title="Page 3">
<div class="section">
<div class="layoutArea">
<div class="column">
<p>Let’s dive into why it’s key to find software that’s purpose-built for a third-party service provider network. Later, we’ll talk about how to get your service provider to use it happily.</p>
<div class="page" title="Page 3">
<div class="section">
<div class="layoutArea">
<div class="column">
<h3>1. Customer Experience is Inconsistent</h3>
<p>Your third-party service providers are representatives of your home services brand. As Field Service News put it:</p>
<blockquote><p>We are no longer just outsourcing repair and maintenance work, we are now outsourcing a critical customer engagement opportunity as well. In this era of digitally empowered consumers, ready to tweet, post or blog every time they have an ax to grind, you want to make pretty darn sure your third-party partners are not letting you down in the [customer satisfaction] stakes.</p></blockquote>
<div class="page" title="Page 3">
<div class="section">
<div class="layoutArea">
<div class="column">
<p>Many field service management solutions include tools that improve the customer experience, such as customer portals, Uber-style service provider tracking, fast on-site payment capabilities, and an instant feedback feature. When your centralized service staff uses these tools, they create a consistent experience for your customers.</p>
<p>When you rely on third-party service providers who each use their own set of tools, however, your CX becomes unpredictable. Some of your customers will be treated to a streamlined, professional experience, while others deal with late providers and scribbled paper invoices.</p>
<div class="page" title="Page 4">
<div class="layoutArea">
<div class="column">
<blockquote><p>Americans continue to reward companies that get service right. US consumers say they’re willing to spend 17 percent more to do business with companies that deliver excellent service, up from 14 percent in 2014. As a group, Millennials are willing to spend the most for great care (21% additional), followed by men (19%).</p></blockquote>
<div class="page" title="Page 4">
<div class="layoutArea">
<div class="column">
<h3>2. A Decentralized Workforce = <strong>Decentralized Service Data</strong></h3>
<p>Without an FSM tool that your service providers will easily use, you have no visibility into the service providers that are representing your brand and you are losing access to data that could increase service revenue. Are they arriving on time? Are they fixing the problem the first time? Are they invoicing efficiently?</p>
<div class="page" title="Page 4">
<div class="layoutArea">
<div class="column">
<h3>3. You lose time <strong>and money</strong></h3>
<p>You invested in Field Service Management software to become more efficient, scale your business, and grow your revenue. Without buy-in from your third-party service providers, you lose time that could be saved with real-time status updates, mobile capture, and invoicing. As we all know, time is money.</p>
<p>Download the white paper to learn more about how you can attract new talent while building independent service provider loyalty.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Do you have a customer loyalty process in place? If not, it could be costing you. Research commissioned by American Express says that </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">33% of consumers consider switching brands</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> after just one instance of poor customer service.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To boost customer loyalty, it makes sense to start at the end: Customers often judge your brand by the last interaction they have with you—and since that final interaction is usually with your third-party service providers, these partners can make or break your customer loyalty scores.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you have constant turnover in your service provider network, your customers are the ones who feel the pinch. Miscommunication, missed appointments, service professionals with little knowledge of your brand, and other problems pop up, sinking the </span><a href="https://dispatch.me/solutions/by-need/customer-experience/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">customer experience</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> you spent so long building up.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Because service provider loyalty can have a huge impact on customer loyalty, you want to make working with you as easy for them as possible.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So how do you keep </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">both</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of these groups happy?</span></p>
<h2><strong>How Can I Improve Service Provider and Customer Loyalty?</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Consider your service providers and customers as a two-sided market and your field service management software as the intermediary to build loyalty among both parties.</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Offer multiple ways to connect</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Keep important information—like job status, contact information, and customer photos—flowing between your brand, your customers, and your service providers to keep all parties on the same page.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Make sharing job details easy, fast &amp; clear</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Use an app that shares customer and job details with your service providers—so the customer doesn’t have to explain the issue multiple times, and the service provider has easy access to the information they need to get the job done quickly and efficiently.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Increase service provider loyalty with the right tools</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. A field service management tool that doesn’t integrate with your providers’ in-house software is just another app for them juggle—which can affect your service provider loyalty.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Let customers have their say</b>. Customers want to be heard, so make it easy for them to share their kudos and critiques.</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now let’s get all the details on the table.</span></p>
<h2><strong>Offer Multiple Ways to Connect</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nothing frustrates a customer faster than communication issues with their order. Whether it’s a missed tracking number or a multi-layered phone tree to reach a customer service rep, every stumbling block put in your customer’s way reduces the chance that they’ll buy from you again.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Your service provider network needs easy communication with both you </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">and</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> your end customers to keep appointments on time and customer information up to date.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In both cases, offering multiple channels of communication can help keep information flowing where it needs to go. For example, you might offer a web portal where customers can upload details about their work orders, including photographs. With access to this information, along with a centralized database of customer information, your service providers can do their jobs more efficiently. An app can come into play for service and appointment updates, reducing the number of customer no-shows.</span></p>

<h2><strong>Make Sharing Job Details Easy, Fast &amp; Clear</strong></h2>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Forbes</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> says that </span><a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/shephyken/2019/10/13/customer-loyalty-and-retention-are-in-decline/#33ac06ae4329"><span style="font-weight: 400;">77% of consumers consider convenience a key factor</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in choosing service providers. If your order or service process is confusing or requires customers to jump through too many hoops, they’re going to start looking for a clearer experience elsewhere.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One sticking point for customers is in getting the details of their service order to the provider. If you’re making your customers explain their situation to two or three different people, they’re going to be frustrated before your service partner ever arrives at their home.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You can eliminate that problem, and increase customer loyalty, with a</span> <a href="https://dispatch.me/solutions/service-providers/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">field service management</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> app that allows your providers to easily view the customer’s history and information. They’ll arrive at your customer’s home with the right tools and parts, and your customer won’t have to repeat the whole conversation they just had with your customer care team.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Your field service management software makes the process more convenient for your service partners, too. You can give them access to product information, knowledge bases, and customer data that they need to find answers to any customer questions and get the job done quickly.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">An FSM tool also helps improve service providers’ first-time fix rate (since they’ll have a better understanding of the job before they arrive at the customer’s home), which will further improve customer experience.</span></p>
<h2><strong>Increase Service Provider Loyalty with The Right Tools</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The service management tool you choose needs to enhance your service provider’s workflow. Otherwise, it becomes just one more app taking up space on their phone or tablet—hardly the way to increase service provider loyalty.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The right platform gives you </span><a href="https://dispatch.me/how-are-your-3rd-party-contractors-doing-heres-how-to-find-out/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">visibility into how your service partners are doing</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, while also helping them do their jobs. Give them an easy way to assign and track jobs, see customer notes and photos, and accept payments in the field, and your providers will be much happier to use the tool.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If your platform can integrate with tools your service providers are already using, like QuickBooks, ServiceMax, and Zapier, it’ll improve compliance even further. No one likes having to enter the same information into three different web portals, or having to juggle payment processors.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But if you can bring all of these pieces of their business together into one field service management tool, they’ll be much happier to use it.</span></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="wp-image-14468 aligncenter" src="https://dispatch.me/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/How-to-Ace-Your-Customer-and-Service-Provider-Loyalty2.png" alt="" width="600" height="281" srcset="https://dispatch.me/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/How-to-Ace-Your-Customer-and-Service-Provider-Loyalty2.png 953w, https://dispatch.me/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/How-to-Ace-Your-Customer-and-Service-Provider-Loyalty2-300x140.png 300w, https://dispatch.me/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/How-to-Ace-Your-Customer-and-Service-Provider-Loyalty2-768x359.png 768w, https://dispatch.me/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/How-to-Ace-Your-Customer-and-Service-Provider-Loyalty2-500x234.png 500w, https://dispatch.me/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/How-to-Ace-Your-Customer-and-Service-Provider-Loyalty2-791x370.png 791w, https://dispatch.me/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/How-to-Ace-Your-Customer-and-Service-Provider-Loyalty2-380x178.png 380w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<h2><strong>Let Customers Have Their Say</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Customer feedback is essential to understanding what you’re doing right, and where you need to improve. Tweaking your business operations based on common feedback is a great way to improve your customer retention rates.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But your customers don’t want to have to type in a URL or call a phone number on their invoice. If you make it difficult for your customers to give you feedback, you’ll probably only hear from the really motivated ones (both furious and thrilled). This can give you a skewed sense of how your customers feel about your field service business.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Instead, give your customers a way to leave feedback instantly. Asking them to rate you and/or your service provider immediately after the job’s done means that the job is fresh in the customer’s mind. And with the right customer feedback tool, you and your service providers can spot trends and opportunities for improvement.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Customer loyalty and service provider loyalty are both critical to your brand’s success. By employing tactics and tools to keep both of these groups happy, you can cut down on customer service-related expenses—and keep your business growing.</span></p>
<p><b>Struggling with ways to help your third-party service providers delight your customers?</b></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>If there is one thing that Amazon.com is about, it’s its obsessive attention to customer experience. Investors should be investing in a company that is obsessing over customer experience. In the long-term, there is never any misalignment between customer interest and shareholder interest.</h2>
<p>Jeff Bezos, CEO Amazon. July 13, 1999</p>
<p>Today’s consumer has access to more information and tools than ever before. With a single Google search, consumers can find the best price for a given product in a matter of seconds.</p>
<p>The only sustainable, long-term differentiator for companies is the end-to-end customer experience customers receive when interacting with a brand. Brands which differentiate by delivering superlative customer experiences will cash in on greater customer wallet share and lifetime value, ultimately netting greater profits and investor returns.</p>
<p>This is because a happy customer <a href="https://www.customerservicemanager.com/how-to-conduct-business-to-business-customer-satisfaction-surveys/">contributes 2.6 times as much revenue</a> as a somewhat satisfied customer and 14 times as much revenue as a somewhat dissatisfied customer. Thus, the need for better customer experience spans many different industries.</p>
<p>The biggest hinderance home service brands face today is delivering a seamless, omnichannel, digital and data-driven experience that connects all parties, including 3rd-party service providers, throughout the customer purchase and home service fulfillment process.</p>
<p>After powering millions of home service jobs in over 30% of the homes in America, here is what we’ve learned for how you can cash in on the home services space.</p>
<h1><strong>Why There is an Opportunity to Cash in on the Home Services Space</strong></h1>
<p>In the early 2000s, home service companies built customer relationships on their own terms. Brands only communicated with customers when they wanted – typically through mailers and calls, or worse, no communication at all, leaving customers in the dark about the status and timing of their home services. Traditional retailers did a fair job executing product sales and deliveries but struggled to execute on expectations set with customers about the home services experience customers would receive.</p>
<p>Over time, due to the rise of the internet, mobile technologies, social media, and lower barriers to entry for new retailers due to the commoditization of hardware/cloud computing, the consumer rose to the forefront, ultimately having an unlimited choice about who, when and where they would purchase. Consumers suddenly had a megaphone to share the negative (and positive) experiences they were receiving from brands, and the ability to quickly and affordably shift their brand loyalty to brands who focused on CX. Industries outside of the field service arena adopted and implemented new technologies to help bridge the gap between the brand and the customer.</p>
<p>This puts pressure on brands to offer the same level of service to their customers in a tech-driven way. When they do, they can expect to see some drastic improvements to their customer SAT, NPS, revenue, and customer lifetime value.</p>
<p>Here are some of the outcomes service brands can expect after implementing customer experience tools.</p>
<h1><strong>Two-Way Communication Tools Improve Brand Perception</strong></h1>
<p>Kudos to you if you’re messaging with your customer about their home services appointment. MAJOR kudos to you if your tool allows for two-way communication with that same customer to create engaging experiences.</p>
<p>Home service companies that enable dynamic communication between them and their customer receive more information up front, which does two things: creates a sense of confidence in the customer’s mind, and allows for seamless fulfillment of the service.</p>
<p><a href="https://dispatch.me">Dispatch</a> allows customers and service providers to directly connect with each other in a bi-directional, modern and meaningful way while empowering the consumer to provide information (notes, photos, updates) to the service provider in advance of service execution. Not only is the customer-empowered, but the service provider is well informed about the service the consumer is expecting to have fulfilled&#8230;.and before appointment execution.</p>
<h1><strong>Automatic Appointment Reminders Improve Customer No-Show Rate</strong></h1>
<p>By keeping consumers informed of the status of their service appointment, including on the day of service, brands can reduce costs associated with customer no shows and reschedule requests. Automatic appointment reminders prevent this from happening.</p>
<h2><a href="https://www.helpscout.com/75-customer-service-facts-quotes-statistics/">54%</a> of millennials prefer to communicate with brands through either mobile or email.</h2>
<p>Not only do consumers prefer to communicate bi-directionally, based on experiences they are having with brands, but consumers expect this level of communication so they are informed and not left in the dark waiting. According to Forrester “The majority (66%) of adults feel that valuing their time is the most important thing a company can do to provide them with good online <a href="https://www.helpscout.com/75-customer-service-facts-quotes-statistics/">customer experience</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://dispatch.me">Dispatch’s</a> omnichannel communication tool delivers email, SMS, push, WhatsApp, or whichever communication method your customers prefer at the right moment.</p>
<h1><strong>Instant Feedback Helps Monitor NPS</strong></h1>
<p>As we evolve in today’s tech-driven world, the importance of immediate data capture becomes vital to reduce customer churn. While every brand will occasionally fail with service delivery, it is essential to be able to immediately act on subpar customer feedback. If your service experience is lacking, then customer switching costs are low and the customer won’t buy more of your product.</p>
<h2>Gauging service experience and remedying poor experiences as they happen has led to a 6% reduction in customer churn (2018 Dispatch customer data study).</h2>
<h1><strong>What is the next step for service companies?</strong></h1>
<p>Brands looking to capitalize on the service space need to realize that it’s all about customer experience. Jeff Bezos had it right in 1999 – amazing service is one of the most important long-term and sustainable differentiators that a brand can build. Done right, positive home services experiences will net greater customer wallet-share, customer lifetime value, and incremental product and services revenue for any brand.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3><span style="color: #000000;"><b>Building Retail Customer Loyalty through Home Service</b></span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The retail landscape has changed fundamentally over the past 20 years. The Internet gave rise to eCommerce, allowing giants like Amazon to offer a wider selection of products than brick and mortar retailers at lower prices, delivered right to your door.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Experts expected this new level of choice and convenience to slowly kill off retail stores, but that simply didn’t happen. As a matter of fact, the <a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://nrf.com/insights/economy/state-retail&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1615823376943000&amp;usg=AOvVaw3NTb1XnWRm326nl6Fyt3om">National Retail Federation</a> says brick and mortar retail has been growing at roughly 4% per year since 2010, with eCommerce sales only accounting for 10% of all retail sales across the industry.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">No, brick and mortar retail didn’t die when threatened by the Amazons of the world <span style="color: #0fc132;">&#8211; </span></span><span style="color: #0fc132;"><b>but it did evolve.</b></span></p>
<h3><b>Give the people what they need</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Recognizing this threat, consumer electronics retailer Best Buy reconsidered what would keep people coming through their doors. You can buy a new laptop anywhere, but what happens when that laptop breaks? Best Buy knew that </span><span style="color: #0fc132;"><b>excellent service experiences are what built customer loyalty</b></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and made the savvy move of acquiring Geek Squad in 2002. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The concept was simple &#8211; we know that we are going to lose sales to Amazon. We know people can buy a new laptop anywhere, including from the comfort of their own home. But what happens when that laptop breaks?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nearly 20 years later, Geek Squad has become synonymous with computer repair. Representing a modest but not insignificant <a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.retailwire.com/discussion/has-walmart-come-up-with-an-answer-to-best-buys-geek-squad/%23:~:text%3DBest%2520Buy%2520generates%2520five%2520percent,a%2520Talking%2520Business%2520%2526%2520Politics%2520report&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1615823376945000&amp;usg=AOvVaw02bjKNgF7B0q35FtFFPlMT">5% of their overall revenue</a>, the real value of Geek Squad comes from: </span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Expanding their business beyond the products they sell, </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Getting people into the store who may end up buying something they weren’t planning on buying</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Creating additional opportunities for loyalty-building customer service experiences.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Suddenly, Best Buy could make some money off of products they didn’t sell in the first place. Completely new revenue; turning a negative into a positive.</span></p>
<h3><span style="color: #000000;"><b>Modern customer loyalty</b></span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many stores have caught on to this, including Amazon, and now offer service, maintenance, and installation along with the products they sell. According to American Express, ‘U.S. consumers are willing to spend 17% more to do business with companies that deliver excellent service, up from 14% in 2014.’ So it stands to reason that </span><span style="color: #0fc132;"><b>adding service options to your product sales gives you more opportunity to build loyalty.</b></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The need for service is clear, but how do you deliver it consistently to your customers, and not turn your great opportunity to build loyalty into another lost customer?</span></p>
<h3><b>A declaration of independence</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Today, retailers are turning to independent service providers to provide service to their customers. Whether you’re mounting a TV or installing an HVAC system, having the right service provider on deck to do a job is critical to adding significant service revenue to your bottom line.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the absence of a fully trained and skilled workforce, you can offer your jobs to independent contractors. This is where Dispatch comes in.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dispatch gives you </span><span style="color: #0fc132;"><b>a platform to onboard and manage your service providers</b></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, ensuring you have the coverage you need to earn service revenue and customer loyalty across the country. Of course, you need to make sure your providers are delivering consistently excellent service experiences to your customers if you hope to build loyalty, so a platform that allows you to control the customer experience and understand customer satisfaction is critical.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you are a retailer that is looking for a way to take control of your service offering and ensure you are taking advantage of these critical loyalty-building opportunities, take a look at what Dispatch has to offer:</span></p>

<h4><b>How Bloomin’ Blinds partners with Dispatch to conquer “Big, Ha</b><b>iry, Audacious” Goals</b></h4>
<p><b>“</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> We would like to be the new, modern version of window coverings—not only in our business model, but in our technology and how we handle ourselves and our customers. Having Dispatch is helping us make progress toward our goals.&#8221; </span><br />
<span style="color: #0fc132;">&#8211; Kelsey Stuart, CEO <a style="color: #0fc132;" href="https://www.bloominblinds.com/">Bloomin’ Blinds</a></span></p>
<h4><b>Growing quickly, Bloomin’ Blinds is a Trailblazer in Window Coverings</b></h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Founded in 2001, Bloomin’ Blinds is a family-run business with big aspirations. The company launched its franchise group in 2014, and now has 40 owners operating in 52 territories. But CEO Kelsey Stuart wants to grow even more, and has what he calls “big, hairy, audacious goals”—like becoming a household name, adding another 50 franchise owners in the next two years, and welcoming 250-300 new owners in the next five years. “We w</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">ant some extraordinarily expansive growth,” he says.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-14719 aligncenter" src="https://dispatch.me/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/footer-logo.png" alt="" width="458" height="75" srcset="https://dispatch.me/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/footer-logo.png 458w, https://dispatch.me/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/footer-logo-300x49.png 300w, https://dispatch.me/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/footer-logo-380x62.png 380w" sizes="(max-width: 458px) 100vw, 458px" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Lewisville, Texas-based company is going up against nation-wide direct-to-consumer businesses. Stuart gives their competitors props for proving the model—but says they highlight Bloomin’ Blinds’ key differentiator, which is that their franchise owners don’t just sell blinds: they offer an end-to-</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">end solution that includes design consultations, installation, and repairs. Setting themselves apart, Stuart explains “we would like to be the new modern version of window coverings &#8211; not only in our business model, but our technology and how we handle our customers.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bloomin’ Blinds’ current software solutions weren’t helping the</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">m build and deliver on their vision of a comprehensive service offering, so in 2019 Stuart started investigating new options.</span></p>
<h4><b>Bloomin’ Blinds’ Looks</b><b> at the Field of Options</b></h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With sights set on growth, Stuart wanted a solution that would give him visibility into franchise owners’ operations, help him attract new owners, and enable him to improve the customer experience.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img loading="lazy" class="wp-image-1015 alignright" src="https://dispatch.me/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/401k@2x-300x300.png" alt="" width="152" height="152" srcset="https://dispatch.me/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/401k@2x-300x300.png 300w, https://dispatch.me/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/401k@2x-150x150.png 150w, https://dispatch.me/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/401k@2x-500x500.png 500w, https://dispatch.me/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/401k@2x-370x370.png 370w, https://dispatch.me/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/401k@2x-380x380.png 380w, https://dispatch.me/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/401k@2x.png 601w" sizes="(max-width: 152px) 100vw, 152px" /></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We only thrive if our owners thrive,” says Stuart. “And if our franchise owners are providing the same service as competitors, and they&#8217;re providing the same price, but their communication and presentation are better&#8230;all of that leads </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">to buying decisions.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Stuart started looking for a field service management platform that would offer visibility into location performance, a consistently excellent customer experience, a robust FSM tool, quoting capabilities—and that was still accessible to a growing business. He looked at close to 20 providers. Most were missing features Stuart needed or were too expensive, and one refused to even work with a window covering business.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img loading="lazy" class="wp-image-225 alignleft" src="https://dispatch.me/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/favicon-300x300.png" alt="" width="152" height="152" srcset="https://dispatch.me/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/favicon-300x300.png 300w, https://dispatch.me/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/favicon-150x150.png 150w, https://dispatch.me/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/favicon-500x500.png 500w, https://dispatch.me/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/favicon-370x370.png 370w, https://dispatch.me/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/favicon-380x380.png 380w, https://dispatch.me/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/favicon.png 512w" sizes="(max-width: 152px) 100vw, 152px" /></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Finally, he came across Dispatch, a software platform that helps enterprises manage franchise locations and improve the customer experience. “I found that a lot of software solutions are pretty generic in their offerings, and very few of them had the features and benefits that Dispatch had at a price we could manage.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dispatch offered the improved visibility, CRM, quoting capabilities, and other features Stuart was looking for. “I needed a tool that would demonstrate our concern for quality, not just in our products and service, but in our customer communication as well.  Dispatch delivered.”</span></p>
<h4><b>Dispatch Clears the Path to a Succes</b><b>sful Implementation</b></h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Dispatch implementation was Bloomin’ Blinds’ first large-scale software installation—a nerve-wracking experience for any growing business. But Dispatch’s supportive team and integration expertise helped to smooth the way. “We were trying to integrate two different software systems—Dispatch and Solatech window treatment software,” says Stuart. “Having somebody who was responsive, who truly seemed to care about our business and how it was going, really helped us be patient and learn.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img loading="lazy" class="wp-image-802 alignright" src="https://dispatch.me/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Group-18.png" alt="" width="152" height="115" /></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As with any new software implementation, challenges cropped up along the way. “But every time Dispatch found an error, they fixed it,” Stuart says. “Every time that there was something that needed adjustment, they got it corrected.” The Dispatch team also customized workflow and notification features for Bloomin’ Blinds, and created short training videos to help Stuart onboard the rest of the corporate team and franchise owne</span>rs.</p>
<h4><b>Bloomin’ Blinds Cultivates Franchisee Success</b></h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Dispatch platform gives Stuart and his team unprecedented visibility into their franchise owners’ operations, allowing them to jump on problems before they grow too big. “As a franchise owner, I need to have visibility and access into what the franchise owners are doing &#8211; I need to be able to get in, help with issues and help new owners guide and manage the business.” With data from the Dispatch platform, Stuart can see if a franchise owner is struggling with, say, generating new reviews or converting prospects, so his team can offer coaching to help get the owner back on track. “The Dispatch platform has a wealth of informati</span>on,” says Stuart,  “it’s clear that there’s no shortage of data available.”</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While Bloomin’ Blinds is using Dispatch to help manage franchise operations, the franchise owners themselves use the solution to build up their own businesses. “It&#8217;s a tool to help the franchise owners run their business, and they appreciate it for that,” says Stuart. “They also love the simplicity, clean look, and the intuitive nature of the software. Most of them were able to figure it out in fewer tha</span>n 10 repetitions.  Across the board, it’s 100% a win.”</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dispatch’s customer-facing features have also helped set Bloomin’ Blinds apart from others in the industry. Powered by Dispatch, the new online booking page has simplified scheduling for homeowners and franchise owners, enabling customers to </span>request appointments when convenient for them. “The booking page has been a bit hit for us,” says Stuart. “Adding technology-based communication has opened the door for new customers who aren’t naturally comfortable on the phone or need to reach us in off-hours. Since we launched it for our franchise locations, we’ve seen a substantial increase in conversion because it gives the consumer a sense that things are in motion, reducing the need for them to look at other providers. We can capture the business when they’re ready for it, not necessarily just when we’re open.”</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With many automated and tech-enabled communication elements, including automated reminders and on-my-way notifications, Dispatch helps Bloomin’ Blinds leave a positive impression well before the first service appointment. “By the time we </span>ring the doorbell, the customer has already had four or five positive interactions with Bloomin’ Blinds,” explains Stuart, “and that’s a great way to win business.”</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Positive customer reviews have increased, says Stuart, showing that customers appreciate the new features as much as the franchise owners do. “Having these tools really shows that an owner is on their game,” Stuart says.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img loading="lazy" class="wp-image-797 alignright" src="https://dispatch.me/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Group-10.png" alt="" width="130" height="107" /></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bloomin’ Blinds’ big, hairy, audacious goals don’t look so intimidating when they have the right software on their side. “We absolutely use Dispatch as a tool for our franchise growth,” says Stuart. “We’re one of the few window coverings companies in the nation with this kind of innovative technology and customer experience. There’s no doubt, having Dispatch is helping us make progress toward our goals.”</span></p>

<h2>What you’ll learn in <strong>3-minutes</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We&#8217;re reviewing different protocols that will keep your service providers and customers safe while in the field. </span></p>
<h2>Service Provider <strong>Safety:</strong></h2>
<p><strong>If you can, work remotely</strong><br />
Being isolated away from your team and working out of the comfort of your home is the first step in remaining safe. If you can’t work remotely, make sure to restrict all office visitors with case-by-case emergency situations letting people into the office.</p>
<p><strong>Screen for fever every day</strong><br />
Implement active screening of service providers and office staff for a fever every day with an Infrared Forehead Thermometer.</p>
<p><strong>Keep your distance</strong><br />
Experts suggest maintaining six feet of distance between yourself and other people at all times.</p>
<p><strong>Assess everyone’s health before going out</strong><br />
Before every job, ask your service providers and customers if they’re feeling ill. Reschedule the appointment if the answer is yes.</p>
<p><strong>Adopt contactless communication</strong><br />
With photos, messaging, and digital payments, you can minimize the exposure between service providers and customers. Some companies, like <a href="https://www.bloominblinds.com/">Bloomin&#8217; Blinds</a>, are implementing video consultations in order to adapt their business for this contactless world.</p>
<h2>Customer <strong>Safety:</strong></h2>
<p><b>Wear shoe covers and gloves for every job<br />
</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wear new shoe covers and protective gloves every time you enter the homeowner’s home. This helps ensure cleanliness and puts the homeowner at ease.</span></p>
<p><b>Confirm your customer&#8217;s health<br />
</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Communicate with the customer before the job to gauge their health and their family’s health. If anyone is ill, politely ask to reschedule the appointment.</span></p>
<p><b>Meticulously disinfect tools and trucks<br />
</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Disinfect all vehicles and every piece of equipment after each use. This prevents the virus from spreading surface to surface.</span></p>
<p><b>Implement contactless payments<br />
</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Implement paperless billing, credit card payments, receipts/invoices, etc., so that you and the homeowner don’t need to touch anything.</span></p>
<p><b>Always social distance<br />
</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Stay a minimum of 6 feet away from customers and other service providers at all times and if you’re feeling a little under the weather, please stay home. </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We are all experiencing the challenges of the COVID-19 outbreak. Perhaps it’s adjusting to more remote work and communication, or difficulties in keeping your services front of mind with customers. People are staying in and spending less money throughout the nation, and business, as usual, is looking more unusual by the day.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You rely on Dispatch to help you deliver consistently excellent service to your customers every day, and we want to make sure you are getting the most out of the Dispatch product. Below you’ll find a few features you may not have known about &#8211; features that can help you continue to deliver excellent service, even during this challenging time.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Export Your <strong>Customer List</strong></span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Keeping your customers informed about your business can be critical. It’s hard to tell if businesses are still operating &#8211; what’s essential, what’s non-essential &#8211; which can potentially lead to lost business and unsatisfied customers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone wp-image-14623" src="https://dispatch.me/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/SP-Graphic-3-1-300x200.png" alt="Export Your Customer List - Dispatch Technologies" width="600" height="400" srcset="https://dispatch.me/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/SP-Graphic-3-1-300x200.png 300w, https://dispatch.me/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/SP-Graphic-3-1-1024x683.png 1024w, https://dispatch.me/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/SP-Graphic-3-1-768x512.png 768w, https://dispatch.me/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/SP-Graphic-3-1-500x333.png 500w, https://dispatch.me/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/SP-Graphic-3-1-555x370.png 555w, https://dispatch.me/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/SP-Graphic-3-1-380x253.png 380w, https://dispatch.me/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/SP-Graphic-3-1.png 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dispatch gives you access to all of the customers you have serviced through our platform, with their contact information, job history, and more. You can view this information by clicking on </span><strong><i>Reports &gt; Your Customers</i></strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and download it by clicking </span><strong><i>More Options &gt; Download Data</i></strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on the right-hand side of the report. Don’t forget to remove the default 30-day date range to make sure you get everyone!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The resulting list can be uploaded into your marketing software, or dropped directly into an email, depending on the number of customers. This is a great way to easily put a complete customer list together, and use it for updates, offers, marketing, or anything else you need to communicate to your customer.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Branded <strong>Booking Page</strong></span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Did you know that many of our service providers use Dispatch to enable customers to book business directly from a web page? Most companies that use Dispatch can set up our booking and scheduling page, which allows customers to enter their contact information, details about the work they need done, and provide suggested appointment times to reduce the back and forth of finding the right time.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Leads submitted through our Booking Page feed directly into Dispatch for you to assign and complete, just like adding a job manually. You can even include a link to the Booking Page right in your Google business listing or in your email signature.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a time where office visits are no longer an option for letting customers book time, the Dispatch Booking Page can help keep business flowing without the need to interact in person.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you want to enable your free Booking Page, reach out to your franchisor, or <a href="mailto:support@dispatch.me">support@dispatch.me</a>.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Notification <strong>Templates</strong></span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Every service appointment you complete through Dispatch sends several appointment notifications throughout the course of the job &#8211; scheduling, on my way, survey requests, and more. You already know that these are part of our best-in-class customer experience, and typically just include a little bit of information about the next step in the job, and a link to our branded customer portal.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What you may not know is that these notifications can be edited to add specific text to each touchpoint. In addition to providing the basic information, you can include a short message with each notification. </span></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone wp-image-14626" src="https://dispatch.me/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/SP-Graphic-4-2-300x200.png" alt="Customize notification templates - Dispatch technologies" width="600" height="400" srcset="https://dispatch.me/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/SP-Graphic-4-2-300x200.png 300w, https://dispatch.me/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/SP-Graphic-4-2-1024x683.png 1024w, https://dispatch.me/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/SP-Graphic-4-2-768x512.png 768w, https://dispatch.me/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/SP-Graphic-4-2-500x333.png 500w, https://dispatch.me/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/SP-Graphic-4-2-555x370.png 555w, https://dispatch.me/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/SP-Graphic-4-2-380x253.png 380w, https://dispatch.me/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/SP-Graphic-4-2.png 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Right now, many of our users are choosing to add notes about special accommodations or requests regarding staying safe during the outbreak &#8211; asking customers to provide specific information ahead of time, or reminding them to give your technician as much space as possible during the appointment.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For independent service providers, you can add this in the Work app under </span><strong><i>Settings &gt; Company &gt; Branded Emails</i></strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">, in the </span><strong><i>Custom Text (Optional)</i></strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> field. For franchisees, reach out to your franchisor to discuss adjusting this text.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You choose what you want to say to your customers, and we help deliver the message throughout the service appointment.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Take Customer Payments <strong>Remotely</strong></span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Your customers can now view estimates and invoices, approve estimates to begin work and make payments against outstanding invoices &#8211; all from the customer portal!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You choose which billing documents you want to be shown to customers in the customer portal. When you hit Send on a billing document and include the customer’s email address in the recipients, they’ll get a link in their email. Any estimate or invoice not in a DRAFT status is shown in the portal.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone wp-image-14621" src="https://dispatch.me/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/SP-Graphic-1-1-300x200.png" alt="Contactless Payments - Dispatch Technologies" width="600" height="400" srcset="https://dispatch.me/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/SP-Graphic-1-1-300x200.png 300w, https://dispatch.me/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/SP-Graphic-1-1-1024x683.png 1024w, https://dispatch.me/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/SP-Graphic-1-1-768x512.png 768w, https://dispatch.me/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/SP-Graphic-1-1-500x333.png 500w, https://dispatch.me/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/SP-Graphic-1-1-555x370.png 555w, https://dispatch.me/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/SP-Graphic-1-1-380x253.png 380w, https://dispatch.me/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/SP-Graphic-1-1.png 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For users with credit card processing enabled, you can also remotely request and collect payments through the portal, allowing customers to pay for service without interacting with your staff.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Communicate More, <strong>Contact-less</strong></span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the greatest things about using Dispatch is how it helps you open the lines of communication between you and your customers. During a time like this, when in-person communication is not recommended, these Dispatch features offer even more value.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Our service experience notifications and branded customer portal are a great way to keep your customer in the loop throughout a service appointment. If you use our Inbox tool, you can message with customers at any time &#8211; reducing the need for in-person contact at the home or office. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Our customer portal is a great way to interact with your customers, reducing the amount of in-person contact needed to provide high-quality service. Customers can provide notes and photos ahead of time, reducing the need for multiple appointments, and increasing first-time fix rate. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Our customer experience, messaging, and reporting features are all important parts of the Dispatch product, made even more pivotal given the current situation we all find ourselves in. Hopefully, these features will help ease the pain of operating during the time of COVID-19. </span></p>

<h2 class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>Service Provider </b>Safety Checklist<b> for COVID-19</b></span></h2>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>1. If you can, </b></span><span class="s2"><b>work remotely.<br />
</b></span>The first step is working remotely if you can. If you can’t, restrict all office visitors, effective immediately, with case-by-case emergency situations.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>2. Screen for fever and </b></span><span class="s2"><b>respiratory symptoms.<br />
</b></span><span class="s1">Implement active screening of service providers and office staff for fever and respiratory symptoms with an Infrared Forehead Thermometer.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>3. Confirm your customers are </b></span><span class="s2"><b>healthy.<br />
</b></span><span class="s1">Communicate with the customer before the job to gauge their health and their family’s health.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>4. Innovate with </b></span><span class="s2"><b>contactless communication.<br />
</b></span><span class="s1">Implement video chat into your customer outreach to see if it’s necessary to roll a truck or if the job can be serviced via video chat.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>5. Stagger service provider </b></span><span class="s2"><b>work schedules.<br />
</b></span><span class="s1">Stagger work schedules to avoid too many service providers in the office at all times.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>6. Meticulously disinfect </b></span><span class="s2"><b>tools and trucks.<br />
</b></span><span class="s1">Disinfect all vehicles and every piece of equipment after each use. This prevents the spread from surface to surface.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>7. BYOB &#8211; </b></span><span class="s2"><b>”Bring your own bottle.”<br />
</b></span><span class="s1">Avoid company-shared water bottles by bringing your own to work. Make sure to bring it home, and wash it every night.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>8. Wear shoe covers and </b></span><span class="s2"><b>gloves for every job.<br />
</b></span><span class="s1">Wear new shoe covers and protective gloves right when you enter the homeowner’s home. This helps ensure cleanliness and also puts the homeowner at ease.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>9.  Implement </b></span><span class="s2"><b>contactless payments.<br />
</b></span><span class="s1">Implement paperless billing, credit card payments, digital receipts/invoices, etc. so that you and the homeowner don’t need to touch anything.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>10. Always </b></span><span class="s2"><b>social distance.<br />
</b></span><span class="s1">Stay a minimum of 6 feet away from customers and other service providers at all times and if you’re feeling a little under the weather, stay home. </span></p>
